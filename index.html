<br>
<br>
<p> </p>
CHAPTER 1</p>
<p>I FIGURED THE BEST WAY to tell you the story of how I got found is to tell it like we're back on that porch in Nashville. Come back late from closing at Taqueria, all the wiring in your brain frayed and sparking because Jesus and Laticia were yelling for guac and cheese dip like GI&rsquo;s for a medic and because you had to mop up and roll all that silverware before you could go. Toss your tips into the money pile in your closet. Come out for a beer and a smoke. The sun&rsquo;s making golden scales out of our neighbor&rsquo;s roof tiles and diamonds out of the crushed-up quartz in the asphalt. Air&rsquo;s woolly with water. Strips the brown bottles of their wrappers and drips over our knuckles. There&rsquo;s the great Southern critter orgy all around and all night long, the sirens, fiddles, clicks, and belches like a marching band in the middle of The Big One. Mazzy Star from your phone. Alright, you say. So talk.</p>
<p>Couple reasons I dropped out of school and hitchhiked to Panama, one of them being that I spent my whole life being suggested into shit that was supposed to be good for me. I pretty much did the same stuff my brother did in high school&mdash;soccer, newspaper, distance track&mdash;and I went to the same college, too. He's four years older than me so he was a fresh grad working as an analyst in San Fran when I came in as a freshman. Day of my orientation, he wrote me a list of classes I should take, said I might as well major in business like he did. I don't mean any disrespect to Cal or my brother because he was just looking out for me and because there's a lot to learn in a school like that. I know you got a lot out of your philosophy classes when you were there, like with Searle and Dreyfus, rest in peace. My experience there was with kids whose biggest interest in art was how to dress the part and professors who were talking about literary patricide and Great American Novel. But I know I only got myself to blame: I wasn&rsquo;t ready to hunker down and <em>learn</em>, and if I could go back I'd try to get the most out of it. Maybe I'd go for philosophy like you or math like Axel did, if I&rsquo;m up for it. Second reason I left was because I had just broken up with a girl named Alex. She was the realest thing that happened to me and without her just about everything around me went back to make-believe. Last reason, this sounds dumb, but the way things were going I knew I could have gone my whole life without knowing who I was, if I was strong or weak, brave or cowardly. You know how in some of the books we read when we were little there's the boy in the tribe or the village. He's not the strongest or the biggest kid, but he's got a brain and a heart, too. When he gets a little older he leaves his home for a journey. His dad's solemn about it, but he's proud because it's something he's got to do. His mom's sad, and maybe his little sister&rsquo;s so mad at him that she won&rsquo;t even look at him when he leaves. But he goes and runs into people who need his help, and it's scrappy, but he helps them. Months and years pass, and he becomes strong, a leader. Then he comes home and no one recognizes him anymore because he's a man now, with the glint and the shoulders and everything.</p>
<p>Yeah well, none of that happened to me. Most of those six months I spent in my head, walking all day and standing there with my thumb out, getting mad and sad when people would just stare at me or give me the thumbs-up back. I camped wherever I could, worked at a ranch, a hostel, on a boat, on an island, but I wasn't a great worker, and I probably took more than I deserved. The only reason I kept going was that if I couldn&rsquo;t bring anything real back, I could at least tell everyone how many countries I went through. Towards the end I was getting pretty loopy&mdash;I was in my own movie, interviewing myself, talking about the scenery, laughing at my own jokes, making up conversations and fantasies about seeing my friends again, or re-doing things that I messed up with Alex. Maybe you don&rsquo;t know this, but you were about the only friend I had during that time, the only person I really talked to. One time you wrote me while you were teaching English somewhere in Korea. Man, I remember where I was when I got your message, and I remember word-for-word what you said. It was the day before I got caught trying to hop a border. I was camping in a rusty truck bed behind a gas station, and I was deep in my sleeping bag with the hood cinched tight because of all the damn mosquitoes. You said the writing was good and to keep going with it. Probably didn&rsquo;t mean much to you to say that, and I don&rsquo;t know how I got it, seeing as how there was no connection. But I got it and I read it and I was glad to have you as my friend.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you more of what I got up to when I was abroad, but I want to begin on the night before I got found.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>CHAPTER 2</p>
<p>IT WAS FALL, couple months after I got back from Panama. I&rsquo;d been on my way to Albatross, but when I got to the door I realized I&rsquo;d forgotten my ID. So I was walking back to Aashik and Axel&rsquo;s apartment where I was crashing now. A hard rain had come all the night before and through the day, and it&rsquo;d only now just stopped. It was like the great turtle that had us on its back had gone for a dip and finally come up for air, and now the whole water-logged city was dripping and draining off. Every crack and pothole brimmed, the lawns had become rice paddies, and small but mighty rivers took the curbs into the gutters that were dammed with detritus. The leaves were brown and fallen and the ones that weren't stuck to the sidewalk like wet brown paper skittered on it like a kid was pulling them along on a string. Fine specks of rain still played in the air like miniature fireflies, and they landed and lit on your face. Sometimes when you walked under a tree or an eave, a nasty fat drop would find its way on the back of your neck and down between your shoulder blades. It was five or six miles to the apartment and I hadn't brought my earbuds, so I tried to make myself sturdy for it. Put my hood on and my hands in my pockets and tried to think of something nice.</p>
<p>Only the homeless were out now. Man, you know how it is here. They wear clear ponchos flecked with rain and have blue tarps tied with bungee cords over shopping carts that look like they&rsquo;re carrying a garage sale. After the bars have closed and before the coldest cold, you see them setting up for the night, too. Some in the recessed entrances of shopfronts, on the sidewalk, on the grass in People's Park, over the steam vents on campus. They sleep in worn sleeping bags on flattened cardboard. Most of them pull their bags over their faces, and all you see is a covered mound.</p>
<p>One of them didn't cover her face, and I recognized her as the woman I'd seen on my way to the bar. She&rsquo;d been spreading her sleeping bag out over some cardboard. Her beanie had a pink embroidered rose, and it lay beside her. Her bare head was spun from root to tip with fine silver strands. This was somewhere on San Pablo, and I was pretty sure I hadn&rsquo;t passed it, but I asked her to make sure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Albatross?" I said, pointing down the street.</p>
<p>She nodded and pointed the same way. "But you gotta buy me dinner first." Then she cackled, showing her black chasm of a mouth, and I laughed with her.</p>
<p>But she was asleep now and had the sunken and puckered mouth of someone without teeth and the frown of sleeping, worn-out children who look like they&rsquo;re really deep in a good dream. Her beanie was tight over her greasy bangs that curled slightly under it. Tarry flecks of mascara were caught in her lashes, and her face was tanned unevenly like someone who's been skiing with goggles. Her arms were crossed over her chest inside her green sleeping bag, which was pulled up to her chin. It was lined with red flannel and was coming apart at its footbox, the white stuffing poking out of it like it was an old stuffed animal. She was Asian. Japanese was my guess. They've been here longer so they got more time than the other Asians to fall off. She looked about 50.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d seen her around since I was a freshman. She usually sat on the sidewalk of Telegraph where people set up their tents and tables to sell jewelry and Nepalese souvenirs: incense sticks, special stones, singing bowls, pipes. She always wore that same black beanie, and her eyes were always big like she was dazed. Couldn&rsquo;t tell if it was because she was nice or on something. I once saw something strange happen with her, a story that stays with me because I still can&rsquo;t make sense of it.</p>
<p>One Saturday morning a few years back Aashik and I went to get some wet burritos from Cafe Durant. The sun was warming the cool air that came in from the Bay and promised one of those idyllic days that&rsquo;s all we Californians have ever known and so take for granted. The morning carried with it a pleasant lightness because it was game day. Wistful alumni and the parents of students strolled eagerly around Southside and Sproul Hall wearing their blue and gold. Black ticket scalpers on the street corners asked you if you were going to the game, and nappy-headed students in their pajama bottoms and flip flops squinted out into the sunlight from their shabby, carpeted apartments and jaywalked around the traffic to recover from their hangovers by getting a full American breakfast: eggs, bacon, thawed sausage links, thick acidic pancakes soaked in butter and syrup. From the stadium the brass and drumline of the marching band could be heard preparing for the war game.</p>
<p>Aashik and I took this all in from the balcony of Cafe Durant. We were under one of a dozen umbrellas, seated at tables and chairs made of wrought iron that screeched on the cement as you pulled them out. There were about a dozen sorority girls sitting by us who must have woken up hours ago to do their faces. Their skin was bronze and matte, their eyes all dark and exotic, and their bright, lightly oiled hair was pulled up into high ponytails. They were all ready for the game, wearing blue and gold beads, ribbons, and neat white sneakers. Some had gold glitter on their faces and that paint that football players put on under their eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes the idea of a thing can be more powerful and disorienting than the thing itself,&rdquo; I said cryptically, pointing at Aashik&rsquo;s chest with my fork. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because we know that they&rsquo;re part of a sorority that everyone&rsquo;s acting this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What way?&rdquo; He asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel the energy&rsquo;s changed, man?&rdquo; I asked, motioning around. &ldquo;Things are different here because of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He snorted. &ldquo;Eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chakra, man. There&rsquo;s something you might understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we were bussing our tables and putting our plates and cutlery into those black plastic bins, one of them, a little Asian girl in a blue tank top and torn denim shorts, came beside me to do the same. She was a cute girl, one of those girls who looked about half her age&mdash;you&rsquo;d&rsquo;ve dug her. I used my fork to scrape what was left on my plate, and I noticed her face sort of curl up in disgust as she looked at me do that. Okay, I thought.</p>
<p>We left the restaurant and began home. As we waited to cross the street, I heard shouting from behind me. It was through a brief clearing in the stream of students behind me that I saw the Asian girl in her blue tank top and her denim shorts. She was in front of Caff&egrave; Med, where all the vagabonds sit on pieces of cardboard with their gray pitbulls on chains, which lie on their chins with furrowed brows. She was trying to get herself free of the Japanese lady, who was hugging her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go!&rdquo; The girl cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, why&mdash;&rdquo; the woman said, and her arms went limp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop contacting me,&rdquo; I heard the girl say quietly.</p>
<p>The old woman gasped and began to cry. The girl turned away, and I saw that her eyes were wide and shiny, too.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;d the old lady fall off? I wondered as I continued to walk north on dark San Pablo. If she was Japanese, then her parents were probably interned during the war. Lost everything, had to start all over again. They wanted her to be a good student, and she probably was. But how&rsquo;d she fall off like that? I guess it isn&rsquo;t so much a falling off as it is an erosion. Worn down stone by stone till they were islands. My dad for example, he&rsquo;s got a friend who owns a gardening supply store. He and his wife worked there all the time and made a lot of money. They&rsquo;ve got a couple nice cars and a nice house. They have a son, too, who was supposed to become someone. I hung out with him a couple times. He was a year older than me and athletic. Had a stoic look, like he was a young soldier. When I was little I used to do everything really intensely, competitively. Had to win at everything and hurt bad whenever I lost. He was like that, too. This one time my family was over at his house. Big house in a gated community. Pool and tennis court in their backyard. My brother thought it was a fine occasion to put us through a decathlon. Soccer, sprinting, wrestling. We played first to ten, best of five, best of seven. This one time I remember I tried to get past him with the ball, toward the lawn chairs we used as goals, by giving him a shoulder check. Well, he hit the ground hard. Then he suddenly brought his knees to his chest and his hands to his face like I was about to hit him. When he saw me looking at him confused, he just started to cry quietly. My brother and I tried to console him, but he just cried harder and harder. Eventually we helped him up and patted his head and tried to make him laugh by pulling our shorts up to our chests and skipping around.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s homeless now. His parents kicked him out because he'd steal from them and buy heroin. The mom started noticing a lot of her possessions going missing, her clothes, a pearl necklace, even a leather armchair. My dad said he saw him by an on-ramp one day, lying there all burnt in the sun. The mother and father said they'd done all they could for him, and that what he did was his own business now. Man, I remember how they told my parents he&rsquo;d gone to some Stanford summer camp or some shit. Now they were saying this kind of bullshit? So that's it then? You did all you could, end of story? Imagine his mother holding her newborn son in her arms and someone coming in to tell her that someday she&rsquo;d kick him out of her house. I don&rsquo;t know. I guess it's hard enough trying to get your own life right to worry about someone else's. And I guess it&rsquo;s true that there&rsquo;s a point where you just can&rsquo;t reach a person anymore. I&rsquo;ve never gone out of my way to really help anyone either.</p>
<p>Like just a couple days back, Alex had contacted me. She was going to school in Seattle now as a transfer. She told me that she had kept up with my writing during my travels, and she was wondering if I was back now. We caught up for a bit, and I asked her how she was doing. &ldquo;People are nice,&rdquo; she said. I remembered she said the same thing during her first week at Emerson as a freshman. We&rsquo;d spent the summer after we graduated from high school talking for hours almost every day, and there&rsquo;d been nothing else but the next thing she was going to say.</p>
<p>She told me she was having a little trouble in Seattle, and that she wasn't doing so well in school right now. She said she wasn&rsquo;t okay. She'd never said that to me before. I always knew there was something going on with her. During that summer she told me that when she was little her parents and her older sister fought a lot and sometimes she&rsquo;d punch the wall by her bed. She was never sad or down when we were together, but I always had the feeling that I never got to the bottom of her. Now she was telling me something important, and all I said was: "Sorry to hear that." She said she&rsquo;d be alright, and we talked about something else. But afterward that made me think again about that phone call when we were eighteen. &ldquo;People are nice,&rdquo; she had said, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a bummer because there&rsquo;s none as smart as you here.&rdquo; She was always really good at saying things like that. When it was time to go, I said: "See you when I see you?" "I love you, too," she said. And I said, "I love you, too." She said she'd never said that to anyone. &ldquo;So what do we do now?&rdquo; I asked her. She said maybe it meant that we should always be there for each other. &ldquo;Deal,&rdquo; I said. I didn't think too seriously about that at the time because I thought she was gone now. And the truth is that what I&rsquo;m telling you isn&rsquo;t that important because it was a long time ago and she's probably forgotten all about it. But I wish I&rsquo;d kept my end of the bargain.</p>
<p>All of a sudden I wanted to go back to that Japanese lady and wake her up and ask her what happened to her, that one Saturday morning I&rsquo;d seen her trying to hug a girl, and&mdash;<em>who was she to you? Where&rsquo;s your family?</em> But I didn't and never would. That's the thing with the homeless here. They love to talk. I figure it's because they got no one who'll listen to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I continued east on University toward campus. The walking isn&rsquo;t so good here because the streets are wide and a lot of the stores are out of business. There were many empty, weedy lots contained by chain link fences. The panels of sidewalk bulged over tree roots or were cracked by tremors. A blacked-out sports car ripped down the avenue toward me. As it idled at the stoplight before me, its muffled stereo made the car shudder and its licence plate rattle. I looked for a moment at its blackened windshield, trying to make out a pair of eyes inside. It drove off. I continued past the bike path that runs perpendicular to University. In the distance, two parallel streets over, I saw the orange glow of a dome tent.</p>
<p>About a week ago I&rsquo;d spent my night walking on that bike path, a five-mile route called the Ohlone Greenway which runs along the BART line. On the grassy shoulder of the path, backed against a wooden fence, I saw a woman trying to set that tent up. Those dome tents are tricky by yourself, so I helped her set it up. She didn't look dirty or anything, she could have been my friend&rsquo;s mom. She looked about fifty-five, and she had this nice, thick mane of silver hair. Anyway, she was really grateful and said I was really nice. She was an artist, she said, and pointed to her black bag, the big square ones that hold canvases. I asked her what kind of painting she did, and she went on and on about being down and out, how she was saving for a studio right now, how her boyfriend had kicked her out, how his cat had scratched her eye, and how she'd had a bad reaction. She peeled back her eyelid and showed me her eyeball. I leaned over and said "Oh, yeah." Man, she wouldn't stop. I told her I had to go and gave her a couple bucks. She gave me a big hug and said would I come visit her?</p>
<p>I said I would.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>CHAPTER 3</p>
<p>THERE ARE A COUPLE CHARACTERS you see all the time around Berkeley. Like the guy Aashik and I always got a kick out of. He's an old Indian guy with an afro that's turning white at the roots. He's always wearing a dirty tan tunic and matching pants. Something about his eyes, too. There was fire in them, like he was capable of something very violent or very generous. The first couple times we saw him, up by Sproul Gate, we thought he was holding his hand out to me and saying "Asian, Asian." But later I realized he was saying "Any change, any change," which makes more sense. There's an old white guy who looks like he should be on a Roman coin. Got the white beard and the nose for it. I always see him lounging on some bench on campus, looking like he's eating grapes from the vine at a feast. He's always moving around campus with his big body bag, the kind that military guys have, only his is blue. In my head I called him Marcus Aurelius. One time I saw him reading him a paperback by those benches outside Dwinelle. I was so curious about what he was reading that I circled back around him. I got down on one knee to pretend to tie my shoe and got a look at the cover. It was one of those harlequin romances, with a Tarzan-looking fellow on the cover. With one hand he's holding a girl wearing a nightgown, and like a ship's mast with the other. And the way I was looking up at him, you couldn't have seen it otherwise, but one of his hands was down his sweatpants. After that he became Caligula.</p>
<p>Caligula likes to sleep on a steam vent by a gutter on Bancroft, below the tennis courts. I bet you've walked by that gutter at night and heard the rats down there going <em>scree, scree, scree</em> like they're fighting a rat war down there. Tonight they were still going at it, even with all the rain, so I figured I&rsquo;d get a look at them once and for all. Got my phone light out and tried to get a look inside. Wet, kitten-sized rats were swarming all over the gutter floor. Rats, you know, they don't have bad faces. They're big mice. I mean, their tails might get you. Thick wormy things, like surgery scars down the belly. But what got me as I waved my light inside the gutter was the madness in their swarming. Far as I could I tell, there was no reason for it&mdash;there was no food nearby, no mating, no fighting, or predator&mdash;but every night I walked past this gutter, rain or shine, their squeals pierced out from the underground. Reminded me of that one Goya painting of Saturn munching on his kid. What gets me about that painting is how helpless his eyes look, like there&rsquo;s some demon inside him calling the shots. Man, you got to have something going on in your head if you can fall asleep right by those rats going at it.</p>
<p>But tonight, because of the rain, he wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>I got a little Caligula story. When I was still in school I once went to this Friday church service that my brother told me to go to. This sophomore named Nathan brought Caligula there, and he just looked confused the whole time. I remember after it was over and I was on my way out, I saw Nathan asking Caligula if he could pray for him. His eyes kind of bulged and he nodded. Nathan thanked God for their meeting and prayed for his health and stuff. I sent a silent prayer over, too, that he could knock his habit of jerking off on campus.</p>
<p>Nathan was nice to me. I thought he was alright. He was really upbeat, the kind of guy you don't want to be around for too long because you don't want to be sullen around him and have him ask you if you want to talk. Kind of guy who&rsquo;d just look at you with a frozen smile if you made a messed up joke around him. Everything's God's will, according to him. If God wills it, he says, like he's trying to take back the Holy Land. He was a short guy with the black plastic glasses and a big smile, big front teeth I remember, and if you weren't too smart then you might think there was something saintly about him. I had told him about my travels and how I wanted to be a writer, and he went around introducing me to the other churchgoers as Tom Sawyer. This one night he hit me up and asked me if I was free. We met on the corner of Bancroft and Telegraph, right before Sproul, and the first thing he does when he sees me is he quotes a line from a story I shared with him. I remember the line, and it was a bad, self-important line. Hearing it from his mouth made me realize that. So we start walking through Sproul past the bulletin that's ten deep with fliers and past those trees that line the area. You know what trees I'm talking about? They're not too tall and in the fall they lose their leaves and their stubby branches look like knuckles. Knuckle trees, I think whenever I see them. Anyway, Nathan tells me that he and his girlfriend are going to write a book.</p>
<p>"About what?"</p>
<p>"About God.</p>
<p>"What about him?"</p>
<p>"About his goodness. About his grace, and his majesty."</p>
<p>Then he says the reason he wants to talk to me is because he and his girlfriend want my blessing to write their damn book.</p>
<p>Nathan went to my brother's church in San Francisco, like the whole Cal church group did. That was a long drive, all the way to Daly City. I remember this one sermon by this guy named Pastor Ryan. Big brutal guy, liked to wear cardigans. He had this one sermon about selflessness and all I remember about it is him talking about how these pop stars rented out a whole hospital for the birth of their baby, and that made them selfish. And about how he bought an iPad for his son who didn't like to share it, and that was also selfish but not as selfish as renting out a whole hospital and kicking out everyone on life support. He&rsquo;s one of those guys who&rsquo;s a better orator than a thinker, who tries to mask his bullshit with rhetoric. At the end of the sermon he tells us that when you get God, <em>he&rsquo;ll move your bowels</em>. That made me laugh, and a couple people turned around and looked at me. At lunch I sat down by my brother and tried to talk to him about what he got out of it all. This and that, he said. I knew he'd been sleeping for most of it. Head back with his mouth open. My brother does this thing where if he doesn't want to talk he'll ignore you. You ask him something important and he'll get this dark look on his face and pretend he didn't hear you.</p>
<p>Reason I was going to church in the first place was that after I got back from Panama, I spent a month at my brother's. &ldquo;Of course, man,&rdquo; he replied when I messaged him to see if I could stay at his place. When I arrived he asked me if he could use my suitcase for when he went to New York to see his girlfriend. His was too small. I emptied the suitcase of my things. He took his things out of his suitcase and placed them in mine. This suitcase was also his. He had left it at home four years ago, and I had used it since. I looked around his small studio apartment. A two-counter kitchenette, a bathroom peeling and cracked at its edges and corners, a large TV on the wall, a desk that was being used as a shelf for his button-down shirts, slacks, and documents. His queen bed took up about half the studio. There was barely any room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you break this?&rdquo; He asked me. He jerked the suitcase handle again and again, but it wouldn't go in fully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He kept doing it, violently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Christ, I thought. What did it matter?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you break it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix it&mdash;I&rsquo;ll fix it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took the suitcase from him and set it down, putting my hand into the siding of the case to feel the metal and using the other to try to get the handle in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to fix it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stopped.&ldquo;Just put the stuff back into the other suitcase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did as he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need to get a job,&rdquo; he said once I had finished and looked up.</p>
<p>I agreed.</p>
<p>He told me to take a shower. I stood under the hot water, and I remember thinking about how I wanted to stay under the water forever, how good it would be if the hot water could soften me so I could start taking myself apart under it, like peel my lips off and pluck my nose off and step out of my loose skin and have my bones crumble like sandstone in my fingers and just go into the drain so I wouldn't leave a mess for my brother. Man, I was a burden.</p>
<p>Only work I found was writing for a magazine. They had an opening for an internship and wanted some writing samples. So I sent in a story about my travels to the editor. It's about how I came by some money, went like this:</p>
<p>The road was new and black with shiny crumbs on its shoulder that crunched as you walked on them. It had bold yellow dashes that were neatly squared off on each end. The road curved through the pine forest. The air was colder and fresher here because of the elevation. Before I had gotten to the ranch I made camp in the forest and woke up to frost on the outside of my sleeping bag. But the goose down had lofted overnight, and I only felt the cold wind as a gentle tugging.</p>
<p>There were many monarch butterflies before me now. They were like delicate orange leaves that never fell. When I was little I read about how every year millions of them migrated to a forest near Mexico City. I thought how fantastic that forest must have been to attract them, and that it must have had magical qualities. Now I knew that I was in that place. There was a photo in the magazine of thousands of them covering a big tree. It would have been grotesque as it is with pill bugs swarming over one another on a river rock or spiders with hair-like legs stacked on top of one another in a dark basement corner. But the monarchs were beautiful in the way that they opened and closed upon the tree trunks, and the labor with which they flew, wobbly like a newborn calf. They were the color of your eyelids when you lie in the sun with your eyes closed, and around their wings they were polka-dotted with black and white like a dress a little girl might wear. To read that every year they made a great journey from all around North America made me think they were brave. It was always a special moment whenever I saw one as a child, and I was always trying to catch them because I hated to see them leave.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A white car came around a bend and stopped for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo; The woman asked me as we drove. She was clean and neat, early thirties. Her car was clean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-one,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Older than you,&rdquo; she smiled.</p>
<p>A few minutes into the ride she placed her hand on my thigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your legs,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you run?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to, but not anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's not common to wear shorts in Mexico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. But I'm traveling. It's more comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have pants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your backpack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I'll change in Toluca.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should change now.&rdquo; She pulled over suddenly and looked at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an old broken wall by the highway, and behind it was the pine forest with boughs of red-brown pine needles. It was dry and the ground was soft here and would have made a good place to camp. I went behind the wall with my jeans and put them on over my shorts. She poked her head behind the wall and walked toward me.</p>
<p>I held my hands up. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to pee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We got back in the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is something wrong?&rdquo; She asked me as we drove on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I'm just tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toluca 7 km, read a green sign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you learn Spanish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In school. And here in Mexico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard Asians have small penises. Is that true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go like this,&rdquo; She said after some time, and she lifted her arms shoulder-level.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She reached over slowly towards the water bottle between my legs. She placed her hand on my penis and squeezed. &ldquo;Is that okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told that story to a lot of people who thought it was funny, how that ride wasn't free, and was she hot and everything. Part of that story is a lie, though, and I only told Axel the truth. I did get a ride from someone who touched me. That's true. But it wasn't a girl, it was a guy. And as he drove off, he stopped for a second. I saw his hand drop a couple purple bills from the window. I went and got some tacos with that money and ate them on a big rock by the gas station. There were ants on that rock carrying green shards of leaves and I made a little game of trying to pick them up by their leaves and trading them with crumbs of beef from my taco.</p>
<p>The editor of the magazine called me and said I could write for them. She said I was &ldquo;exceedingly talented.&rdquo; Someone like her had never told me that before, and that made me feel pretty good. Started projecting way into the future about how this was the start of how I was going to be a great writer by paying my dues as a journalist first. I wrote a first draft, a self-important thing that they rejected and a second one, another self-important thing that they rejected again. Finally I wrote about meeting Aashik in Canc&uacute;n during my travels. They said it was very good, and that was a big relief for me. But apart from that I couldn't bring myself to write about things that were happening in Berkeley. They did give me one other story. This was during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The story was getting big because a couple Americans had gotten it at airports. Apparently the robotics department at Cal and a couple other schools were teaming up to fight it. I remember there was this one professor from Texas A&amp;M who said something like: "It's up to us to make a stand against Ebola." But the funniest part of that story was thinking about all these college robots in West Africa, burying the dead and offering their condolences in their robotic voices. But I'm guessing the editors, they knew I was down and out, so I think they were just throwing me a bone.</p>
<p>I slept by my brother's bed on a twin mattress, right in front of the doorway. When his alarm clock rang at 5:30, he sighed heavily and tightened his eyes. He had to step over me to get to the front door, and I tried not to wince as I felt his presence over mine. My brother would always tell me to sleep on his bed as he was leaving. I put the mattress away when he left. He worked all day in finance. What exactly he did I never knew. ETF's, he said. When he came home his eyes would be glassy with fatigue. He&rsquo;d order food for us and we would watch something on his TV. We didn&rsquo;t talk much. Sometimes I cleaned his kitchen and bathroom, and sometimes I wrote. His windows were big and let in a lot of light. At night I took long walks through the city and listened to music.</p>
<p>My brother's the kind of guy who likes to give you a moral and say things like "At the end of the day ... " Like this one time we were going to get some coffee, and he gave this homeless guy outside the cafe a dollar. Then he turned to me and said: "You know, you'd think it's bad to give to the homeless because they'll spend it on drugs or something, but at the end of the day, it's only a dollar."</p>
<p>In all seriousness though, I want to give you an image of my brother for you to hold in your head, but to be honest, I don&rsquo;t know who he is. It&rsquo;s not an easy thing to write about a real person in a book, especially if you&rsquo;ve only spoken about five hours with him in the last decade. What I know for sure is that my brother went through a lot to get to where he is now. Smart guy, hard worker. Now he's making more in a year than I'll make in a lifetime. Man, my dad was a real bastard to him growing up, used to beat the shit out of him and tell him he was incompetent. I remember hiding with my sister while my brother cried and being glad I wasn't him. Hard life, no mistake. My brother used to be left-handed for example, and my dad beat that out of him, so now he's right-handed. I remember when I was little listening to my mom and dad talking at the dinner table about my being left-handed. My dad was saying, "How's he going to hold a gun?" And I remember sitting up against the wall thinking, "Man, when the war comes I'm gonna be pretty useless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One night, not too long after I arrived at my brother&rsquo;s apartment, he took me out to dinner. But first he said my shorts were too short, and he made me change. It was a fancy place, all dim lighting, jazz music, servers wearing bowties and shit. I remember there was actual ivy on the brick walls. I touched the dust leaves to make sure and broke a piece off. Stop, my brother said. We talked a little more when the food came, and he was telling me that I should try to publish what I wrote on my website, about my travels. I said I&rsquo;d think about it.</p>
<p>"Man, I really suffered," I told him.</p>
<p>"You didn't suffer," he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How do you know that?"</p>
<p>"Because no one told you to go. You could have come home anytime you wanted. It&rsquo;s only suffering if you don&rsquo;t have a choice. The Jews in the Holocaust, for example&mdash;man, <em>don&rsquo;t cry</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>CHAPTER 4</p>
<p>SO THAT&rsquo;S WHY I was in Berkeley, walking back home from Albatross after forgetting my wallet. I was crashing at Aashik and Axel's place now, sleeping on a red sleeping bag at the foot of Aashik's bed. They were cool with it, for the most part. I didn&rsquo;t see much of them anyway because they&rsquo;d leave the apartment around six or seven and spend all day on campus, going from class to library to class. Man, I should have kept my head down and cleaned the bathroom and kitchen and stuff seeing as how I wasn&rsquo;t paying them any rent. You&rsquo;re a bum like me so you know how things change when you crash at someone else&rsquo;s place, no matter how cool they are with you in the first place. My damn ego didn&rsquo;t take too kindly to that change, and I mouthed off a lot and was my usual dickhead self. I don&rsquo;t need to tell you this, but I&rsquo;m the kind of guy who&rsquo;s always looking for a reaction from people, and sometimes when I drink I&rsquo;ll do anything to provoke them&mdash;it&rsquo;s not a real night out if I don&rsquo;t end up looking like a fool. I&rsquo;ve got a lot of stories like that, and sometimes they keep me up at night.</p>
<p>But like I said, Axel was a pure math major. Getting a music minor, too. Guy was in the goddamn choir, and they were always doing <em>Requiem</em> or <em>Mass in B Minor</em>. Sometimes you&rsquo;d hear him singing some goddamn opera in the shower, and then he&rsquo;d come out and do twenty straight pull-ups on the bar in his doorway. Aashik was a double major, too, business and economics, always doing work for a club or running some guy&rsquo;s senate campaign. They both had that quality, which is strange to slackers like us, of putting their heads down and squaring themselves to the work they have to get done. And when you hang out with them there&rsquo;s a really great lightness, especially when there&rsquo;s a little liquor involved. The jokes and the laughs come out like it&rsquo;s the funniest you&rsquo;ve ever been, and it reminds me a lot of how we used to play when we were little boys.</p>
<p>The two of them shared a dorm room freshman year, and I remember they told me that on the first day of Welcome Week, all the freshmen buzzing around like little kids on Halloween, they bought a big bag of candy and decided to go around the whole building knocking on doors and introducing themselves. Sometimes I find myself wishing I could have been there with them.</p>
<p>I saw a man walking on Telegraph. His legs crossed over themselves as he walked and he kept running into fire hydrants to keep himself from falling. I jogged over and asked him if he was okay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He wouldn't look at me as he kept walking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had him put his arm around me and we walked slowly together. He told me he lived near the Claremont Hotel which was a few miles away. He was short with gray hair and glasses. There was silver stubble on his face, and his eyes were red and bulged from the drunkenness. He wore a charcoal wool coat over his suit and carried a leather satchel. His name was John. I asked him what he did for a living.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I value and sell smaller companies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His legs twisted underneath him. I tried to grab his waist, but he fell on the cement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm a piece of shit,&rdquo; he said. He began to sob and to rock himself on the ground. &ldquo;I'm a piece of shit. I'm a piece of shit. I'm a fucking loser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I helped him up by the elbow. We started walking again. I asked him if he had kids.</p>
<p>He had a daughter and a son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son hates me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He hates the shit out of me. He's your age. He hates me. I'm a shit dad to him so he hates me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just never been around. My son hates me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re never around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of your job?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does your son like to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play guitar and smoke pot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he want to be a musician?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t want to be anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We walked in silence. As we crossed a street John buckled at the knees and we wheeled as I tried to keep him upright. He lay on the asphalt. His face was blank as he looked at me, like how babies will sometimes stare at you from inside their carriages or over their moms&rsquo; shoulders. I helped him up and took his satchel from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what was your plan?&rdquo; I asked him. &ldquo;Were you just going to walk back home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wanted to feel something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We went up to College where there were more trees and boutique shops. Eventually the Claremont Hotel&rsquo;s highest tower and its palm trees came into view. The hotel was all white and big and long and glowed blue-white at its base.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grunted.</p>
<p>Soggy brown leaves on the sidewalk clung to our shoes like. On the other side of the street a hooded, stooped woman shuffled home. Her face was tanned and wooden. Gray lines of hair came out of her hood. Her hands were in her pockets. She had thick short legs and small feet. She carried a tied plastic bag.</p>
<p>John's arm tightened on my shoulder. He was huffing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now we were in a wealthy neighborhood. It was silent except for the wind and the leaves. The houses were painted in dark colors and some had dark red brick on their first stories. They were large but not monstrous like the ones you see in Southern California, where you don&rsquo;t know what the hell they&rsquo;re trying to be. They had large front yards with big lawns and old big trees that were older and bigger than the houses themselves. None of the lights were on in the houses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost there, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gonna remember me in the morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He snorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got a good story about you and your son?&rdquo; I asked him after some time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He didn't say anything for a minute, and I thought it was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is when my son was six or seven. It was after school. He'd just been diagnosed with diabetes. Doctor told him he should start learning how to inject the insulin himself now because he'd have to start doing it for the rest of his life. That made him different to the other kids, and at first I think he got picked on a little. He was always a really shy kid. But he was always a little different, too. Like our dog Cleveland died one day. Old dog. My wife and I got him when we married. He died when my son was five, and for a good month, he wouldn't stop acting like a dog. Wanted us to put him on a leash and eat from a dog bowl. Panting with his tongue out. Different. Anyway, we taught him how to use the needle, and this one day he had some friends over on our porch. I never saw these kids before, so I assumed he brought them over to show them something. Yeah, he was going to show them how he injected himself. They're all leaning over him, fascinated now, and Caleb my son picks out a vein in his thigh and puts the needle in. But he can't get the insulin in because he hasn't got a good vein, so he tries again. And again, and again. So I'm just watching my son stab himself with a needle with this frozen look on his face, half joy, half, you know, horror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should&rsquo;ve taken that needle out of his hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he said. "I realize that it's not the story you were expecting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got any stories about you guys eating an ice cream or something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed a little. "Fuck off."</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said. We walked down a long lamp-lit driveway to his home. A single wicker chair sat on the front porch. I thought of Caleb there sitting there and John looking through the screen door.&nbsp;</p>
<p>John put his key in the front door, and suddenly he fell twisting away from me again and landing on the cement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't deserve to live,&rdquo; he said. His eyes were wide and his mouth quivered. His hands were up to his chest like he thought I was going to hit him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, John. We&rsquo;re here now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we entered I set his bag on the wooden bench by his front door. We entered his kitchen. The refrigerator was made of stainless steel and had no photos, wedding invitations, or those magnets you get from New York or Paris like the Statue of Liberty or the Eiffel Tower. The house was clean, the furniture was dark and unscuffed, and there were clean wool throws folded neatly on the sofas. There was a cream-white electric guitar hanging in the living room and a big television on the wall. It didn't look like anyone lived there, but I guess that&rsquo;s what people go for. I listened for anyone upstairs, a light to come on and a woman&rsquo;s soft steps or the light crackle of a female joint on the stairs&mdash;&rdquo;<em>John?</em>&rdquo;&mdash;and opened myself up to the bottom of the stairs. But no one came. I found a glass in one of the cabinets by the sink and filled it with water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drink as much as you can,&rdquo; I said and placed it in front of him. He was leaning on the granite island now and staring straight ahead. "Is your wife home?"</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s with another man now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn, what happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheated on her. With one of my coworkers. I never felt desire like that before. Well, my wife found out. Destroyed her. Once I moved out she got really depressed, got hooked on sleeping pills. Figured she might go for it one of these days. So I moved back in and slept on the ground by the bed every night until until she got better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I think about what I did to her, though,&rdquo; he said, and he looked up, breathing slowly and keeping his mouth firm to keep himself from crying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you stayed with her, man. That&rsquo;s something. You didn&rsquo;t have to do that. That&rsquo;s something, man, and it&rsquo;ll come back around soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We stood around the island for some time. John thought for a long time as he looked into space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time for sleep?&rdquo; I asked him.</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>I followed him upstairs and helped him into bed. His dark gray comforter was a heavy down, his white sheets glossy and cool, and his bedframe and his nightstand were made of dark wood. I looked around his bed and imagined his body in different positions on the floor around it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said as he lay in bed. The comforter was up to his chin, and his eyes were wide now.</p>
<p>He motioned for me to give him my hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, thank you,&rdquo; he said, and he kissed it twice.</p>
<p>I took off his shoes and set them by his bed. He closed his eyes. I went to his bathroom to fill his glass and placed it on his nightstand. Then I switched off his light and left out his front door. It was hard to believe that every house in this dark and silent neighborhood had a sleeping family within it. I wondered if I&rsquo;d done anything for John. It was the coldest part of the night now. The wind rattled what hardened leaves were left on the oak trees, and the orange arclight above it put all of its tendrils into silhouette. A busted sprinkler was gurgling like a throat wound and drowning the grass. I felt used up for the miles ahead. Put my hood on and my hands in my pockets and tried to think of something nice.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>CHAPTER 5</p>
<p>I KNOW A LITTLE GIRL who&rsquo;s five or six now, whose dad killed himself. It&rsquo;s probably not right to say anything more than that because I&rsquo;ve only met that little girl twice, and it&rsquo;s not my story to tell. I don&rsquo;t mean to give her family any more pain than what&rsquo;s already been dealt to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The little girl has long black hair and bright dark eyes. The first thing she did when I met her was she asked me if I would play with her, and as we sat down cross-legged on the carpet she looked at my leg hair and started running her hands through it like it was wild seagrass. Then she got real close to my face like I was some strange creature, and I leaned back away from her. I held her tiny hand and thought it looked strangely miniature. Her nails were like little pearl scales, her longest finger no longer than my thumb. As I saw the muscles and joints in her fingers articulate, it was like looking inside the movement of a fine watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing? Are you a doctor?&rdquo; She asked me. She was chomping on a piece of iceberg lettuce.</p>
<p>I laughed and released her. &ldquo;Just looking at your robot hand. Are you a robot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; She cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a girl!&ldquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, robot girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, just girl. <em>Girl</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shrugged.</p>
<p>Throw me,&rdquo; she said, and she raised her arms up to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I picked her little body up, my forearms under her neck and her knees, I realized that this was the first time I&rsquo;d ever held a kid before. As I threw her onto the couch, she shrieked and asked for more.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder if, in those many sleepless, moonlit nights you have as a kid, she asks herself: Why&rsquo;d my dad leave me? How can you kill yourself?</p>
<p>How can you kill yourself?</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re little, killing yourself makes no sense because the world is beautiful. When I was little while my mom was running errands I used to lift up stepping stones to stare at centipedes with their red armor and their wriggling yellows legs, moist fat-banded earthworms writhing half in the earth, glossy black stink bugs aiming their butts at us, rolly-pollies, pincher bugs, spiders and their white eggs webbed to the underside of the stone. Where I grew up, there were a lot of creeks, and that was a different world. Water striders dimpled the water like it was made of glue. The schools of minnows darted and glided smoothly to a stop. I could never catch them because they were too fast, faster than tadpoles. Beneath them red crawfish snapped backwards in plumes of tan dust. The creek floor was scattered with their shells and their antennae that looked like red wire. If you were lucky you might see a box turtle with red on its head and yellow-edged shapes on its shell or a yellow and a shiny black salamander resting on a wet rock. These, with the water snake, were the rarest creatures in the creek and to see one felt monumental, like seeing boobs in a movie. One of the best things I&rsquo;ve ever seen is a water snake, about a foot and a half long, with its engorged mouth on one of the hind legs of a bullfrog. Big frog, size of my fist. The frog was crawling up onto the creek bank with the snake in the water. Its leg was all bloody. Man, I ran over to my dad shouting. I couldn&rsquo;t even make a sentence because of how excited I was. We watched the frog try to crawl up the bank, and I tried to throw rocks at the snake to let it go. My dad wouldn&rsquo;t let me. But I was so sure that the snake was bad for doing what it was doing. Poor frog, I thought, just trying to have a mud bath and catch some flies while this evil snake&rsquo;s trying to bite off his leg.</p>
<p>There were little dark green frogs and purple-brown tadpoles whose spotted, translucent tails trembled in the water. They didn&rsquo;t look anything like each other, and I couldn&rsquo;t believe that they were the same thing. One swam like a fish and nibbled on weeds, and the other sat on its haunches and hopped on land and snapped its tongue to catch flies. But some of the tadpoles had gangly hind legs and tails that were starting to shrink into their fattening bodies, and you thought: so it&rsquo;s true then. Sometimes you saw a clump of clear, dotted jelly floating at the surface of the creek. If you looked closely you could see mini tadpoles inside, like wriggling commas. One time I was reaching for some of these eggs in a creek and all of a sudden a small frog the size of my thumb jumped on my hand, and I tried to turn the thing over to see if it was the mom or the dad.</p>
<p>You could flatten your lungs to sit on a pool floor and feel both afraid and calm, and afterward your fingers would prune. Then later in the bath you could slick your hair up with shampoo. You could make shapes with your sister&rsquo;s long black hairs that were stuck to the shower wall, like the outlines of cars or the profiles of faces. When you let the water out and leaned over the drain you saw it swirl around like a mini-tornado, and it sounded like when you sucked the last of your soda with a straw. On long drives the Californian sun followed you the whole way. The chalky white moon was out, too, like a fossil in the blue sky. You knew your way around town not by street names but by landmarks, like the freeway exit by the soccer fields, the gas station at the intersection, its prices on big black lettering on illuminated yellow signs, the big patchy field of the big middle school you&rsquo;d go to one day, even though that day seemed about as far away as college or the day you&rsquo;d get married. But more than landmarks, you knew your way around by the feeling of a place. As you came back home late at night from the city, you went in and out of consciousness for what seemed like days, but even in such a state you knew when you were pulling up to your home. Arriving felt like the end of a long journey. Falling asleep had the finality of death.</p>
<p>You woke with the freshness of the morning when the sky was still gray and the cold air made you feel rugged once you put on thick socks and a big sweatshirt over your pajamas. You didn&rsquo;t understand why your parents were so groggy in the morning, why they clung to sleep like it was better than life. You didn&rsquo;t have time to sleep because there were whole worlds to fall into, the worlds you created with your toys and the fantastic worlds of your books.</p>
<p>And you felt. There was the torturous anticipation of birthdays and Christmas. There was the darkly regal mood of a movie theater with its crimson curtains and carpet and the smell of popcorn. There was the nervous joy of your father lifting you up in the air, and the same feeling when your brother let you into his company. There was the joy of being your sister&rsquo;s best friend, how it felt like her presence was just an extension of yours. Board games and Fridays and cartoons. New books and movies whose worlds were richer than ours. There was the exhilaration of seeing the girl you liked sit down at her seat in the morning. There was the joy of running out to play soccer with your friends at recess. There was the war-like will to win and the bitterness of defeat. You felt the brotherhood in defending your goal with your teammates and the courage of your goalkeeper. You felt the treachery of their betrayal if they switched teams. You felt the graveness of being down a goal as time ran out, and the desperation as your attempts to score failed. But when you struck the ball into the back of the net as if it were something you hated, there was a moment when you felt like you were underwater. Then pure joy took over you and your teammates and you ran around the field to everyone cheering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was the dark pleasure in thinking about running away from home, and how our parents would be sorry then. When we lost a game or when our parents scolded us our tears were hot and our fists were tight. When we cried there was nothing but the feeling that everything was against us, and sometimes we couldn&rsquo;t stop. You were crying just because you were crying and for a whole bunch of other reasons that didn&rsquo;t have to do with what got you started in the first place, like last weekend why couldn&rsquo;t we go to the beach or why&rsquo;d the mom have to die at the end of the movie? But mostly it was because it just felt good to give everything up and cry.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what happened to that little girl&rsquo;s father that made him do it, but I bet it was pretty cold and bleak in his head when he did it. I bet he had never been more alone. I bet he had pain his whole life and I bet the world was also beautiful for him when he was a kid like it was for all of us, but that things started getting bad when he forgot how to see. And before his daughter was wondering how you could kill yourself, he was wondering how you could not. One hard morning, the white light coming in too bright&mdash;booze not enough, daughter not enough, the pain he&rsquo;d give to everyone around him if he did it not enough&mdash;he got that orange bottle from his medicine cabinet where it&rsquo;s been sitting there glowing for a while now and goes to lie in bed. Takes more than enough pills to see it through and looks around his bed and sees everything like it&rsquo;s for the first time.</p>
<p>What happens to us that the world stops being beautiful? I figure you get a blank dictionary when you&rsquo;re born. Everything&rsquo;s new, everything has meaning, and you have these really rich and full days where you&rsquo;re touching and licking and playing with everything to get that dictionary filled in. I&rsquo;m thinking that&rsquo;s why children look dead when they&rsquo;re asleep, like they&rsquo;re way into a dream. But as you get older there are fewer and fewer new things. You find that you already have a definition for certain things. So instead of interacting with the real world, you just look up your definition of the thing you&rsquo;re interacting with. Pretty soon you got a definition for almost everything there is and ever was in the world. The Vietnam War, dinosaurs, Hiroshima, the Black Plague, Kobe Bryant, Paris in the 20s and Berkeley in the 60s and Tenochtitlan in the 1300s, trench warfare, The Serengeti, that brown Louis Vuitton pattern, mid-century modern furniture, Saudi billionaires, what your grandparents went through, your father as a boy and your wife when you met her, your little girl, the rest of your life.</p>
<p>When you were little, the world was a big mystery. But when you&rsquo;re an adult, it&rsquo;s all gray and stuck in place because you already have every definition. Or so you think. What you really have is the same dictionary that everyone around you has. You forget that you once had very good definitions that came from your own dealings with the world, and that they were what made life fun. But you threw them away because someone in your school makes fun of you for liking something, or because your parents fight in front of you and you thought: &ldquo;Man, I&rsquo;ve been a fool not knowing the way things really are,&rdquo; so you scrambled to redefine things. Fear, that&rsquo;s what makes us give up our own definitions, fear of failure, poverty, of everyone talking behind your back about how you&rsquo;re a freak. Except you even forget the fear and eventually you figure: &ldquo;Oh, I guess that&rsquo;s just the way the world&rsquo;s always been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a right definition for every thing. I&rsquo;m thinking that&rsquo;s what artists mean when they&rsquo;re talking about truth, that&rsquo;s what Dazai meant when he wrote that the masters &ldquo;seemed not to rely in the least on the misconceptions of others,&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s what Rilke meant when he wrote that he was learning how to see. But when you only have that bad dictionary that everyone else has you notice that in comparison to your childhood days you feel much less, you feel that there&rsquo;s nothing new left in the world, that you just go about your day hopping from definition to definition. I mean, that&rsquo;s why we drink and do drugs, that&rsquo;s why we want to fall in love, because for a brief time you have the right definitions again. Makes you a kid, gives you a different set of eyes. It makes you like people, it makes you interested in them, it makes you a better talker and a better listener, and it makes you forget about your troubles. World&rsquo;s beautiful again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But time starts to move faster and faster. A year as an adult is shorter and more forgettable than the length of a child&rsquo;s full day. You&rsquo;ll start to like being asleep more than you like being awake. Maybe one morning you&rsquo;ll squirm to be more comfortable in the red sleeping bag because you didn&rsquo;t bother to get out of your jeans, and there&rsquo;s a crinkling as you shift and you reach into your back pocket and find those bar receipts that you picked up for John the night before.</p>
<p>Man, the mornings were tough. When the light comes in, you can&rsquo;t kid yourself anymore. You think: What kind of performance am I going to have put on for myself today? Every morning I&rsquo;d wake up thinking I was going to make something of the day. Yes, yes, yes, I&rsquo;d think to myself. Then it was like I had all these voices telling me I should make myself a little drink from the rum we had leftover from a party, that I should listen to some music, watch a little video, but most of the time I&rsquo;d spend fantasizing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this scene in the movie <em>King of Comedy</em> where De Niro&rsquo;s in his basement pretending that he&rsquo;s having dinner with this famous comedian who&rsquo;s trying to convince him to take over his show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just for six weeks,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible! I can&rsquo;t even take over my own life for six weeks!&rdquo; De Niro says. &ldquo;What d&rsquo;ya want, the tears to come outta my eyes?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then his mom calls him from upstairs. &rdquo;Rupert! What are ya doing down there? Who&rsquo;re ya talking to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma-aa!&rdquo; He yells. &ldquo;Puh-<em>lease</em>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a funny scene, clever too, because at first you think he&rsquo;s actually at dinner. But watching that made me want to scratch myself out of my skin. Because that&rsquo;s what I was doing all day, man, all day. I&rsquo;m serious. Way more pathetic than that, too. And more evil shit that I won&rsquo;t get into. There&rsquo;s that one Star Trek episode of <em>Black Mirror</em> where this anti-social programmer guy has his own virtual world. Somehow with DNA samples of everyone in his office, he&rsquo;s able to clone them perfectly into his world, which takes place on a spaceship called the USS Callister. That&rsquo;s the name of the episode. This programmer, he&rsquo;s the captain of the ship, and he can do whatever he wants with his co-workers including his boss who shits on him and this new cute girl he clones in. But he&rsquo;s just an ass to them, doesn&rsquo;t even give them genitalia. I thought that was pretty convenient. Think about it, if a messed up guy like that programmer could be the God of his own goddamn <em>world</em>, what do you think he&rsquo;s going to do to his boss and that cute girl and all the women in the office? It&rsquo;s going to get dark real quick. I mean, I get it, you can&rsquo;t make it too messed up. But man, the inside of the head, that&rsquo;s where you <em>are</em> the God of your world, and it can get real evil and sad in there, and maybe you think it&rsquo;s your own little secret, but it all comes out in one way or another. And people can tell, too, especially women. They know when you&rsquo;re off because you always give out more than you want to. What I&rsquo;m trying to say is that <em>King of Comedy</em>, <em>Callister</em>&mdash;that&rsquo;s baby shit. You get inside the head of a pretty good guy, you&rsquo;ll find sicker stuff than that. And I was sick, man, real sick.</p>
<p>But the morning was too early for anything serious. I would have a couple moments of conviction as I listened to music. Then I would have a drink as a reward for having a moment. I drank what alcohol I could find in the kitchen, then I&rsquo;d look at stupid shit on the internet.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t focus, man, not on anything. I just couldn&rsquo;t do it. I&rsquo;m thinking I had some attention problems, sure, and if I had more modern parents they&rsquo;d have put me on some drugs. Thank God they didn&rsquo;t. Real genius move, drugging your kid because he can&rsquo;t sit still. The real problem is that there&rsquo;s nothing worthwhile to focus on. I remember reading about how during the French Revolution all the asylums emptied out because all the patients went to join. Some life-or-death stuff was happening, I figure, so they finally had some kind of purpose. That&rsquo;s the problem with today, man, the stakes are too low for anyone to care. There&rsquo;s a reason there are so many motivational videos and quotes and all that logotherapy bullshit these days. If what they were saying was true, we wouldn&rsquo;t need so many iterations of it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d spend the morning drinking until I felt the warmth of Alex&rsquo;s presence. Then it&rsquo;d be time for my nap. I'd stumble over to my sleeping bag on the floor of Aashik&rsquo;s room, and Alex would be there beside me. I would kiss my forearm as if it were her shoulder. I would bring her hips toward mine. I felt such a tenderness for her, I wanted to tuck my head into her neck and smell the roots of her hair behind her ear just as I used to. It smelled faintly of fennel, like her mouth did in a deep kiss. I wanted to tell her everything, man, I wanted to tell her that I was more lost than ever. I wanted her to tell me that none of this was true and how could I think that? I&rsquo;d nestle deeply into this warm world and sift through my fantasies before choosing one that would take me away:</p>
<p><em>Her face is flushed and shiny as it is when she is out of breath or after we have made love. She has a box in her arms. She holds it above her swollen belly. She sets the box down with the others and wipes her temple with her sleeve. I take her hands and we slide in our socks across the empty wooden floor.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;No rules?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;No rules,&rdquo; she smiles.</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you, waking up from those naps was the worst part about being alive. Man, consciousness just comes into your head like a sickness, like you&rsquo;ve just heard some really bad news which I guess is that you&rsquo;re you. Put it this way, when you haven&rsquo;t eaten all day you want to bite into a juicy beef patty with some melted cheddar on top, and when you&rsquo;re dead-tired you want to close the curtains of your room and fall onto the mattress of your bed. And when you do, there&rsquo;s a deep satisfaction that perfectly complements the hunger or the fatigue. A perfect fit. I know you&rsquo;ve felt this loneliness or this emptiness or this ennui that I&rsquo;m talking about, and that the pain lies in the fact that its mate doesn&rsquo;t seem to exist. No one, no thing could remedy it for you. All you can do is lie there like you&rsquo;re naked on a cliff&rsquo;s edge during a storm, till it goes away.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d lie in my sleeping bag for a lot of the day, so I&rsquo;d hear things through the wall. Sometimes the clack of fingernails on the drywall, the scuff of hair, the thud of a skull. I figured our neighbor&rsquo;s got her bed right up against the half-inch of drywall between us, and her head&rsquo;s right by mine. It&rsquo;s nice to think about. I knew it was a girl because sometimes I heard her talk on the phone with her head against the wall. I&rsquo;d never seen her though&mdash;I mean, I&rsquo;d probably seen her in passing outside our apartment before, but I didn&rsquo;t know whose head was right by mine. And I couldn&rsquo;t make out what she said exactly, only the emotion behind it, and I&rsquo;d hear her laugh, too. It was a good laugh, like she could really let go and lose herself in whatever made her laugh. That&rsquo;s a good quality, and people will like you for it.</p>
<p>Sometimes she cried, too, about once a week. She&rsquo;s got a strange way of crying. You know how when soccer players get fouled, they&rsquo;ll roll on the grass, grabbing their ankles and screaming? What I&rsquo;ve noticed is that when the worst offenders actually get seriously hurt, they&rsquo;ll just lie there, not making a sound and covering their faces, which are screwed up and far away. There&rsquo;s a singularity to serious pain, where you&rsquo;re taken away from everyone and everything and put deep before some abyss. Point is, there were no waterworks with this girl. She just sounded very tired and very beatdown. What she does is she makes that eerie moan that people make when they&rsquo;ve had the wind knocked out of them. &ldquo;<em>Eee-eee-eee</em>.&rdquo; Then she&rsquo;d sob heavily. I could feel it in the walls. Then that sound again. &ldquo;<em>Eee-eee-eee</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>CHAPTER 6</p>
<p>SOMETIMES I THINK I'd be better off in prison. Every Tuesday my library&rsquo;s got this used book sale. Every book&rsquo;s either fifty cents or a dollar, depending on if it's a paperback or a hardcover, and every time I go there I get a couple books. I figure it&rsquo;s all the adult children of the old people clearing out their childhood homes when they die and donating all their books to the library. That&rsquo;s my guess because every sometimes you&rsquo;ll open up a nice edition of a classic and find an inscription. Other day I bought a nice hardcover poetry book, and when I opened it I saw that someone had written, in really nice handwriting that no one&rsquo;s got anymore:&nbsp;</p>
<center><p>Al,</p>
<p>Warm friends lie within these pages ...</p>
<p>Happy Anniversary, with love.</p>
<p>Connie</p>
<p>7.7.82</p></center>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad to see, because you can kind of tell when no one&rsquo;s read a book before because none of the pages are bent and the pages smell new. But I get it. Reading&rsquo;s hard. I&rsquo;ve got hundreds of books now, and I&rsquo;ve only read a couple dozen of them. The one book I carried with me while I was travelling through Central America was <em>The Brothers Karamazov. </em>That&rsquo;s a big book. I remember telling you that I was reading it, and you were asking me what the damn epigraph meant and who my favorite character was. Yeah, I never read that goddamn book. Ended up giving it to a Cuban named Magdial in Nicaragua. How I met that guy is a long story, so I&rsquo;ll start with how I got into that country.</p>
<p>There are hidden trails near every border in Central America that the locals use to go between countries. I used them until I got caught about a mile into Costa Rica. A family of five in an old pick-up truck took me a few miles before the Costa Rican border which is called Pe&ntilde;as Blancas. I sat in the back on some plastic crates of lettuce with an old man and his two grandsons. The calm shore of Lago de Managua was only twenty feet away to our left, and it looked like it must flood the road when it rained. The gray-brown volcanoes Concepci&oacute;n and Maderas were on the lake's island, Ometepe. They were stout and matte and looked flat on the horizon like a myth on silkscreen. The wind took our words from our mouths so we pointed at the lake and the volcanoes and smiled. We stopped a few times to cool the engine with water. There were mango trees along the road. Each tree was forty feet high and carried hundreds of small plump yellow mangoes. There were hundreds of them on the ground, some fermenting and hairy with ants and already part of the ground, and others that were freckled, soft, and goldenrod. It was easy to kick some leaves around to find the good ones, and we returned to the truck bed with them in the bellies of our shirts. Warm syrupy juice spiraled away into the air as we sucked on the mangoes. The pulp stuck in my bottom teeth. The boys and I made a game of throwing the slimy flat stones as far as we could into the dry fields. If you threw it like you were skipping stones on a lake shore then it cut nicely through the wind before it fell curving down. The grandfather was still young with black and silver hair and smiled at us. He gave me a small, square bag of water that was cold and dripping. I tore into its plastic corner with my teeth and emptied it down my throat. He put his hand out for the plastic which he put into the front pocket of his jeans, and he smiled as I wiped my mouth.</p>
<p>They let me off at the border. I doubled back and turned west into the yellow grazing fields and hiked through a few miles of light and dry jungle. The roots of the trees here were dry and came off the ground like thick, dusty vines. There were a few cattle fences along the way, three or four horizontal barbed wires held up by vertical branches that I jumped over. I decided to stay west of the highway entering Costa Rica, keeping it in sight, and continued for a few miles like this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soon I came across a dry riverbed There were trees whose network of thick roots was exposed like those mangroves, though there was no river here. I hopped over the riverbed and walking down its bank I found myself in a natural shelter formed by the wide trunks and roots of several large trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Ey!&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>I startled. A man sat against the trunk of one of these trees. He had a white LA Dodgers cap, a purple shirt, and white board shorts. He was light brown and a little overweight. His name was Charlie, he said, and he tossed his passport at my feet. It was true. He said he&rsquo;d been waiting in the grove for a friend who was coming illegally from Costa Rica into Nicaragua. His friend was bringing Charlie's girlfriend. She's black, he said, so it's more dangerous for her. He said that just beyond the clearing were patrols of Nicaraguan military and Costa Rican immigration. They were staking the river that bridged the border because it was a point of territorial dispute for the two countries. They were also on the lookout for illegals. Charlie said when it got dark in an hour he would guide me part of the way and that he had crossed four or five times already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We sat under the tree. I told him about my travels and showed him some pictures on my camera. I told him I wanted to get to the World Cup in Brazil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;La Mundial? <em>Puta</em>. There are a lot of black women in Brazil, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably. More than here.&rdquo; I reached into my bag and tossed him a mango. His eyes brightened when he caught it, and we ate together.</p>
<p>We began before it was completely dark, before the hills and the trees were completely black with the night sky. Charlie walked fast, and his arms swung loosely. I hunched as I followed him and clutched my backpack straps if I had to run. The dead brush was thick and crunched as you walked. About half an hour in we saw a man in white leaning against a tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shh, shh,&rdquo; Charlie said. &ldquo;Inmigraci&oacute;n.&rdquo; He started walking quietly toward the man who startled up against the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Ey!&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;Charlie spun around and ran past me, and I ran after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Ey! Ey!&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>We ran through the brush, swishing loudly over the hollow dry stalks of grass. I felt an emptiness in my stomach and a twitching in the hollow of my temples. I looked back and saw a wild beam of light flailing into the night sky like an unleashed hose. We dropped onto our stomachs and breathed silently into the ground. Dust entered my mouth. I gathered spit in my mouth and let it drip down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did he stop?&rdquo; I whispered to Charlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s afraid,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There are robbers around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We started moving again when the beam of light was gone. Charlie patted his pockets and cursed. He had lost his phone and his passport. I told him we could go back and look for them where we were lying down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They're gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We saw two more officials in white walking the opposite direction on the path to our left, about fifty feet away. Military and immigration travel in pairs, he whispered to me. I asked Charlie to take off his white cap and his white shorts. He took off his shorts and wrapped his cap in them. Then three figures carrying bags passed quickly by us on the path. They didn&rsquo;t notice us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Ey!&rdquo;</em> Charlie whispered.</p>
<p>They were two men and one woman also crossing the border. They were sharp and wary as they looked at us, and they walked on quickly. We began again once they were some distance away. I wondered how long it would be before there were homes and lights and stores.</p>
<p>Charlie stopped. He said he was going back now because the way was clear now. I thanked him and moved on. The walking was faster, and I grew more sure with each step. The two men and women ahead of me will be discovered before me, I thought.</p>
<p>Two black figures suddenly appeared before me. They had the stocky builds of soldiers in uniform, and the nozzles of big guns came out of their silhouettes. We stopped and looked at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Ey! Ey!&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>I ran toward the brush toward the highway, remembering that Charlie said they wouldn't shoot, that they would only shoot into the sky as a warning. My backpack bounced up and down, and I cursed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Ey! Ey! Ey!&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>I waited for a bullet in my back. I wondered if it would penetrate my backpack, my laptop and my clothes and all of the small things along the way. Then I was stuck. There were vines across my legs. I tried to break through them, but they were too strong. I grunted and kept pushing with only my toes on the ground. I could hear them getting closer so I bounced off the vines and fell backward on the ground. I growled and righted myself and began another way, but I tripped on a root and they were above me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Don't move! Don't move!</em>&rdquo; A gun was dug into my chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Okay okay okay okay okay!</em>&rdquo; I said. I put my hands on the nozzle of the gun. I had never had a gun on me before. I wondered if a bullet could go through both my hands and into my body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Don't move!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Okay okay okay okay.&rdquo; </em>I lay still.<em> &ldquo;</em>Okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They pulled me up. One of them grabbed a fistful of my shirt. His nails dug into my chest. He put his light on my legs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pobrecito,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>I looked down and saw many long curving cuts on my thighs. The tops of my socks were yellow and red. I looked at the vines I couldn&rsquo;t break through and saw that it was a barbed cattle fence.</p>
<p>He put the light in my face. &ldquo;De donde eres?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Los Estados Unidos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&iquest;Americano?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Si.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to the other one. &ldquo;&iquest;Americano?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was taken back the way I came. They asked me how much I was paid to guide the others. I told them I wasn&rsquo;t guiding them. They told me to call for the others. I told them I didn&rsquo;t know their names. They told me to call for the others. I told them I didn&rsquo;t know their names.</p>
<p>They brought me to the porch of a military post. It looked like an old abandoned home with a tin roof and concrete floors. The captain there shined a light up and down my body and stopped at my legs. He whistled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wire?&rdquo; He asked. He was a big Spanish man with a mustache and a day&rsquo;s growth of stubble. He had a masculine hairline, prominently curved at the bow of his head and receding at his temples, and the body of a fighter&mdash;thick in the neck and wrists and built for sudden bursts of power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Can I have some water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain called to the two men for water. They brought a plastic jug to him. He drank from it slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahhh,&rdquo; he said when he finished, and he wiped his mouth. His forearms and his hands were combed over with patchy black hair, and his skin was bare only at the swollen joints of his fingers. He handed me the jug which had a finger&rsquo;s width left.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>We went inside the house which looked like an old classroom and which was empty except for a table and three or four chairs. There was a chalkboard on the wall and as I entered the room a man with a damp rag was quickly erasing in long strokes what was written on it. There were cracks in the concrete floor and yellow tufts of grass growing out of them. Mold grew on the crumbling pink walls like strong black ink through paper. The house smelled earthy and dusty from the dried feces of bats and rats. The captain sat down with his legs far apart because his gut and his thighs looked like they were going to burst. His black leather boots were laced up to their hook eyelets nearly to the middle of his calf. A black handgun was holstered to his waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you run?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard your men &hellip;&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t know how to say &ldquo;cock their guns&rdquo; in Spanish so I said &ldquo;<em>chik-chik</em>&rdquo; and mimicked the action.</p>
<p>He frowned. He took out his walkie-talkie and asked one of the men who brought me if this was true.</p>
<p>He turned to me. &ldquo;He says he dropped his gun. He says that's what you heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mentiroso,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a note of everything in my backpack. We went through each coin&rsquo;s nationality as he counted all the change I had. He was impressed with my travels. If I struck him in the head hard enough, I thought, I might be able to escape. But I&rsquo;ve never struck anyone in the head before.</p>
<p>I was driven to a military base in the back of a convoy with another soldier. I looked down the road and thought about jumping out of the back. The soldier, who had a rifle between his knees, told me to calm down. We entered the metal gates of a military base which opened into a large concrete yard. Men and women in their baggy green fatigues walked around, and several other convoys were parked here. The Nicaraguan flag, the three stripes of blue-white-blue, stood on a pole in the center of the yard. We came out the back of the convoy and they brought me through a lobby and into a drab, dusty room. It looked like an old principal&rsquo;s office. There were crates with files and an old yellowed computer turned on its side in the room. An old man with bushy gray eyebrows and mustache sat behind a desk there. His green uniform has stars, stripes, and chevrons on its epaulets and breast. He told me to sit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you <em>efeh beh ee</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you efeh beh ee?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Efeh beh ee? Efeh beh ee,&rdquo; I translated the letters in my head. &ldquo;FBI? No! I'm a student,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I'm traveling!&rdquo; I forced myself to laugh. I reached into my wallet for my student ID. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took my ID from me and moved his glasses up off his face. Then he set it down and stared at me. He asked me how much I was paid to guide the others, who they were, and how I knew the way into Costa Rica. I told him I knew nothing about that. He motioned for me to put my backpack on the table and searched through it and took photos of everything. He had problems working the flash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want flash,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He went through my notebook and took photos of some pages. I sat up in my seat to see which ones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your diary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you worried I'm taking pictures of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's personal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You write a lot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shrugged.</p>
<p>He shook my empty backpack onto the table. Bits of paper, dirt, a plastic spoon, and some pens fell out. He took photos of my cuts and mugshots of my profiles. Then he sent me into another room where a medic looked at my cuts. There were about a dozen in total, curving and perforated. They were coagulating into a brown paste and were stiffening now. I knew they were there when I moved, but there was not very much pain because they were shallow. She used a tongue depressor to spread a white cream over my cuts. It stung like she was moving the tips of grass blades over them, and I wanted to itch between the cuts. She dipped the same depressor again and again into the jar and there were flakes of blood and dirt in it when she was finished.</p>
<p>We drove to the border immigration office a few miles north. They went through my backpack and made a note of everything that was inside. They sent me to sit on a bench in the lobby. Some of the younger ones came over and took photos of my thighs with their flip phones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would be taken to Managua in the morning. They took me to a cell in the back of the building. There was a cot for the guard outside it. Within were two bunk beds with thin blue mattresses. There was a woman who was white with curly hair and rectangular glasses. She asked me through the bars what had happened. I told her. She told me to put my hands through the barred window on the door. She held them in hers gently and examined the cuts on them and asked me more questions. I was too tired for that. Another official came in and told me to give him his hands. He handcuffed me. Orders, he told me. I asked him if he would give me a book out of my backpack. I have three, I said. No.</p>
<p>There were messages and tags from other illegals written on the white cinder block walls. There were names with dates and Bible verses. One of them was only a few days old:</p>
<center><p>Trust in the Lord with all your heart</p>
<p>and lean not on your own understanding.</p>
<p>In all your ways submit to him,</p>
<p>and he will make your paths straight.</p>
<p>- James, Ghana</p></center>
<p>I lay on one of the bunks with my cuffed hands on my chest and my knees up so the blood and cream wouldn&rsquo;t get on the mattress. I felt the metal bars of the bunk under me. I got to thinking about how great it would be if I could stop time. In the morning I&rsquo;d uncuff myself. Then I&rsquo;d find my passport and stamp it twice for entry and exit. I&rsquo;d walk south, take a car and drive for a few days. Race down the aisles of grocery stores in shopping carts and eat whatever I wanted. But if time was stopped then wouldn&rsquo;t air molecules be suspended? So how could I breathe? Did matter beyond my body keep their properties when time was stopped? Was water still wet, was the sun still hot, did air molecules vibrate to make sound? Would I be able to swim or would the ocean be as solid as ice? It shouldn&rsquo;t be possible to disturb matter when time was stopped. Otherwise the matter I disturbed would disturb other matter which would disturb other matter. Did time stop for my organs? Would food go bad? No, the food would never go bad. It would never be hard or impossible to move. I&rsquo;d spend a week on the beach, find a room in a great hotel and eat anything I wanted. The water would be normal moving water so I could swim. The mosquitoes would leave me alone. I would practice riding a motorcycle for a few days, I would learn how to fly a small plane and take it down to Rio. Axel would be there&mdash;he was studying abroad in Santiago and we&rsquo;d talked about meeting up to see a game together. We&rsquo;d have a good time partying and making new friends and meeting girls. But why stop there? I could turn myself around back to San Diego and ask for a trial with a semi-pro team. I&rsquo;d slow down time as much as I needed to make sure that I was the best and fastest player on the pitch. Then I&rsquo;d work my way up to the national team and come June I&rsquo;d be adjusting my armband and walking on cleated feet out the tunnel to the roar of 80,000 Brazilians.</p>

<p>CHAPTER 7</p>
<p>There was Magdial from Cuba, Adnan from Syria, James from Ghana, and Chris from Oklahoma, who was the only other American. I can&rsquo;t remember the names of any of the other men, though I do remember their faces. You need a name to anchor a face. Without it, a face eventually blurs into a soft, ethnic composite. In total there were forty men in the detention center from Bulgaria, Ethiopia, Ghana, Somalia, Syria, Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, and Nepal. They were refugees who were making their way up to America by seeking asylum in each country along the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Of the forty I was the only one traveling south. Everyone but Oklahoman Chris was going north to America. He was a short and portly man, wearing a faded shirt that was big for him and with a big hole in its belly. There was something motherly about him, and he said it was good to meet an American for a change. He had been taken in by the police because he was drunk in the streets of Honduras, having no papers, had been brought here. He said he had a Honduran wife and kids and a hog farm. I asked him what was going to happen to him. He was sad when he said that he would probably have to leave his family and go back to America.</p>
<p>The center was a plain single-story building, almost like a library you&rsquo;d find in a small town in the midwest. You entered through the shabby offices of government workers and out into a courtyard where the men sat. I hiked up my shorts to expose my cut thighs when I entered. Everyone stared at me and then at my legs. Across the yard was a large room with about twenty-five bunk beds and a bathroom. There were tiled walls that separated the toilets and showers. The toilets were holes in the ground, and the showers were small pipes about chest-high that dribbled water.</p>
<p>Countrymen stayed together, and they took turns playing ping-pong in the courtyard. The ball had a hairline fracture and bounced dead sometimes. Indians played cards in the yard, Bangladeshis puffed smoke out the barbed-wire fence toward an empty lot. Magdial, Adnan, Chris and I spent our time together. Magdial was a stocky Spanish-looking young man, only a little older than me. He was friendly and his voice often took on a high pitch when he was excited. Adnan was a tall and serious man with a shaved head who was in his mid-thirties. He was an accountant who&rsquo;d left Mosul before Syria&rsquo;s civil war a few months ago. For six months, he and Magdial, having flown into Brazil from Havana and Mosul, had made their way north. With a local guide they had hired, he and a group of other refugees crossed the Darien Gap on foot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once during a river crossing with only a line of rope from bank to bank, an old man had nearly drowned. Just go yourself, he told Magdial. But Magdial managed to drag him through and they lay on the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was our lives, man! Our lives! Fuck! For me, this isn&rsquo;t traveling. For me this is life and death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he asked me why I hadn&rsquo;t just crossed legally I didn&rsquo;t have an answer. As an American I had to pay a fine of $80. Aashik wired me the money immediately and another $70 on top of that. Some of the other men would not be processed for weeks. A tall Bulgarian man with a severe nose told me he had been caught at the border and sent to prison for six months before he arrived at the detention center. He showed me the bedsores on his sides from having to sleep on the bare floor.</p>
<p>James from Ghana slept across from me. He was always lying in his bed and looking up at the bunk above him. Whenever he walked by me I&rsquo;d give him a nod. He&rsquo;d just look at me. I thought he was just being an ass. One day saw him kneeling by his bed on the second day, and when he was done and had dusted his knees I asked him if he was praying. Yes, he said. I told him I had seen the verse he had written in the bunk room, and we talked. He spread peanut butter on a slice of bread and gave it to me. The inmates were allowed to pay the immigration officials to buy food for them. It was with Adnan his third week in the detention center.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my country this is jail,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In my country I am a good man. For me this is jail. I have never even been to jail, but this is jail for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of his friends and extended family were in New York. He had seen photos of them online about how they lived now. He said he wouldn&rsquo;t live like them. He said he would save up all his money and send it back to his wife and children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she plays games with me, man. She plays games with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the guy started to cry. I didn&rsquo;t know what to do. All I could do was look at him.</p>
<p>There was one woman whose name I never learned. She slept alone in the female quarters. She had a mohawk, not the spiky kind, but a thick strip that ended in a mullet. On the whiteboard in the yard she drew fake Chinese symbols, skull-and-crossbones, and the word &ldquo;revolucion&rdquo; over and over. At night we heard her howl and curse in Spanish. Some of the men shouted back. <em>Shut the fuck up, crazy bitch. </em>But no one knew why she was here, and we were afraid of her.</p>
<p>In the yard we played rummy and ate lunch. It was always some form of rice and beans on a plastic plate, which the men grumbled about, but I stayed quiet. It was better than I had been eating the past couple months, and we got it three times a day. The woman approached me and said that she was a doctor who could treat the cuts on my thighs. She placed her hands on my calves. I told her I was okay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't let her touch you, dude,&rdquo; Magdial whispered to me. &ldquo;It was drugs. Drugs made her into a crazy bitch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Magdial told me that when he first saw my legs he thought I had been tortured, that I was Yakuza, which made me laugh. Now the white cream had attracted gray dust and combined with my browned blood into a dry gravy that flaked off my thighs. Adnan and Magdial told me I needed to see a doctor, but I knew it wasn&rsquo;t serious. There were many cuts, but none of them were deep or swollen. I carefully rinsed them in the dribbling shower each day, and in the afternoon I lay in the sun to dry them.</p>
<p>There was a small television in the room. The men were fixed on it. They stared at the pop stars dispatching villains in their music videos, celebrities sharing self-effacing anecdotes to adoring hosts and audiences, chefs adding handsome vegetables to blenders.</p>
<p>I tried to read a little. They wouldn&rsquo;t let us bring our things in, but they let me bring in a book when I flipped through the pages for them and showed them there was nothing inside. I got in my bunk and lay there trying to read the first page. Magdial had told me to pile two of the thin mattresses on the bunk so the metal bars wouldn&rsquo;t dig into you. Once he came over on his way to the bathroom and looked at the cover.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Brothers Karamazov?&rdquo; He said. He said it like a real Russian would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was really excited and said it was his favorite book and that he&rsquo;d been meaning to read it again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s so much soul in him, man. If you want soul, all you need is Dostoesvky,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;&lsquo;God and the devil rage, man, and their battlefield is the heart of man, man.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was my last day in the center, and I figured I&rsquo;d never get around to reading the book anyway, so I gave it to him. He was really happy, like I&rsquo;d just given him a hundred bucks. One of the Bangladeshis was lying in bed with a cigarette. I offered him some change for one, but he said it was okay. We smoked as we lay in our bunks. There were no more good stories to tell one another. The ceiling fan clicked and took the smoke away. There were the squeals of our droopy spring mattresses, the soft pound of chalky feet on the blasted concrete, the traffic beyond, and the clean metronomic clucks of ping pong in the yard. Murmurs in Spanish, Hindi, Arabic, and Somali blended low. I wrote and rewrote lists and drew and redrew calendars of what I was going to do with the next two years of my life. In the summer I would go to Alaska where my friend John was. I had met him when I worked during the winter at a ranch in northern California. I would walk the docks every morning and ask for a job on a salmon boat. If I couldn&rsquo;t get one I would gut fish in a cannery. When I had enough money I&rsquo;d go buy land in a forest in Montana or Idaho. I&rsquo;d build a small cabin near a snow-fed stream I could use to cook and drink. I&rsquo;d get the right tools and learn how to use them. I&rsquo;d get a book on the local flora and fauna so I could forage for berries and mushrooms, and I&rsquo;d fish and hunt small game and cook it on a wood stove. The stove would warm the cabin. I would bring all my books and make a big bookshelf for them. It&rsquo;d be painful and I&rsquo;d probably go crazy, but maybe it&rsquo;d let me get a grip.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>CHAPTER 8</p>
<p>THERE WAS A BLACKOUT on campus that night. Reason was, someone had stolen copper wire from some place outside campus, and that had somehow caused an explosion on campus. It came out of one of those steam vents. A man-sized fireball, I heard. I thought about all those rats going <em>scree, scree, scree</em> as they were roasted alive. I looked it up and apparently the price of copper has been going up over the past couple years and you could get a lot for that wire. But what really interested me was the guy who orchestrated it all. I mean, who do you know who&rsquo;s got the brains to monitor copper prices and find out where there&rsquo;s a lot of it <em>and</em> got the balls to break the law like that? That&rsquo;s a guy who likes life.</p>
<p>I figured it was a good night to walk around campus because there would be nobody around and it&rsquo;d be pitch black. I was wearing the same thing I was wearing the night before when I helped John out, just a hoodie and some jeans. I walked out of the apartment and came out onto the street. Parker St, where you used to live, too. The air was cold off the damp ground, and it was a good sight to see the beginnings of bright green sprouts out of the unkept lawns of the houses nearby. It looked like the rain had gone for good, and where the cement was now beginning to dry looked stained by oil. I walked out on Telegraph. For once the Campanile wasn&rsquo;t lit up. I passed by that one izakaya Japanese joint where they&rsquo;ll serve you all kinds of food and drinks for hours. They&rsquo;re open late, and when all the guests have gone, all the employees hang out over some tea or spirits inside there. I&rsquo;ve never set foot inside, but it&rsquo;s got that old Japanese feel to it, all cramped and cozy with dim lighting, like it would have been the local tavern when the Portuguese missionaries landed there. Naturally a place like that attracted a lot of young hip types, who&rsquo;d have to wait outside under heat lamps. It&rsquo;s not bad walking on Telegraph. There&rsquo;s still a lot of life left on it, and it&rsquo;s good to be around good food, cafes, and young students hurrying home or young couples holding hands with that brightness and generosity in their eyes. I like looking at young couples. For one thing, they know that right where they are is where they should be. Sometimes I find myself wishing I were 18 again so I could do things the right way. I hadn&rsquo;t stepped far out enough into the world to do anything with what I had then.</p>
<p>I passed by the red-and-white striped awning of Moe&rsquo;s with its four stories like a big candy store. There weren&rsquo;t many people inside. A funny clarinet piece was playing over the speakers inside. It was one of those pieces of music that you could play to show how serious a part music had in your life. I figure it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before Moe&rsquo;s is gone, like Caffe Med across the street is now. If you remember, Moe&rsquo;s is where you sold my copy of <em>Notes from the Underground</em> because you needed laundry money. That story gets funnier and funnier the older I get.</p>
<p>I got to thinking about what it&rsquo;s like in those first moments of meeting someone who turns out to be a very good friend. I think it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;ve been walking through a thick forest your whole life. In the beginning you might have started off on the wide trail with a whole band, your brother and sister, your parents, and your childhood friends. But you lose them along the way and go off on your own, following old overgrown trails that people have left behind. Sometimes you follow these trails looking for something and you find a dead guy, and I guess that&rsquo;s what it feels like to read something true that was written a long time ago, one of those things you&rsquo;ve known all along but never had the words for. Sometimes you meet some people in some strange places, but it doesn&rsquo;t take long to figure out that you&rsquo;re looking for different things. Sometimes it&rsquo;s nice to just talk to someone, but you know it can&rsquo;t go on for too long. And it can get thorny if that someone is a pretty girl. But most of the time it&rsquo;s a lonely walk, and it can really wear you down a little every day. But then there are those rare times, that you&rsquo;ll get maybe three or four times in your life, where you haven&rsquo;t seen a soul for days and suddenly you come across someone sweating and glowing alongside you.</p>
<p>I remember I first met you at a concert on campus just before I left for Mexico. Alan brought you along, and we passed around 40s and joints. You were a good-looking man with a head of curls. You were built like a linebacker, but you had the eyes of someone who&rsquo;s had his fair share of pain. You kept your hands in your jacket pockets and looked around a lot. You didn&rsquo;t really move to the music, but neither did I. After the concert we found out we lived on the same street so we walked back home together. You said you liked Russian literature like Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, and you were studying philosophy. At that time I didn&rsquo;t think very much of philosophy because I didn&rsquo;t know much about it. I asked you if you wanted to be a writer. Yes, you said carefully. I told you I wanted to be one, too. We didn&rsquo;t get to know each other too well before I left for Central America, but there was the understanding that when the time was right we would be good friends.</p>
<p>Well, I was in Central America for six months, and after you graduated you went to Korea to teach English. I think we were both lonely for good company, and I was glad I had someone to talk to during that time. I wrote about my travels online, and you were about the only person who gave me your thoughts on it. Like I said, you probably didn&rsquo;t know this then, but writing was the only thing I had going for me at that time.</p>
<p>Anyway, I got up to Sproul, and I could already feel something different about the place. Maybe you&rsquo;ve felt the same when the electricity&rsquo;s out at your place, and I don&rsquo;t even know if there&rsquo;s any science behind it, but when there&rsquo;s no electricity, or maybe when you know there&rsquo;s no electricity, things feel different. Feels calm, really calm, all the way to the bottom of your lungs like when you take a long drag. I wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was because that low hum that&rsquo;s always around when you&rsquo;re in the grid was gone, or if it was because the entirety of campus was in blackness. The Campanile, which you can always see from across the Bay was unlit for once, all of the lights that glow up plants and trees were gone, and there was no one around. It was like you&rsquo;d entered a quiet forest.</p>
<p>When you don&rsquo;t have electricity for a long time, you change. We chatted once about this, how all our automation was turning us into automatons. Take two different approaches to making a cup of tea, for example. The modern way is to use a tap to fill an electric kettle, turn it on, wait for it to boil, and plop a tea bag inside. The primitive way would be to light a fire for which you needed to have gathered kindling, stoke it to create an even flame, gather water from a stream for water, strip a few leaves from a plant, etc. The manual nature of primitive tasks makes you engage with the world&mdash;the hot fire, the cold water, the scented leaves&mdash;and it&rsquo;s this physical engagement that grounds you in the reality of who you are. You aren&rsquo;t a king with a servant for everything, and you aren&rsquo;t a god who&rsquo;s impervious to fire and breathing smoke or catching a cold if you fall into the stream. You&rsquo;re an animal man. I had a psych professor who in our discussion of bias said that the mind always looks for the most cognitively lazy way out. What I think he meant is that there&rsquo;s a part of us that wants to turn ourselves into automatons, to nestle ourselves in kingly physical comfort so that we can nestle also in delusion. But as you know, the comforts of the body are at odds with the comforts of the soul.</p>
<p>During our chat you mentioned Jung&rsquo;s Bollingen Tower. I found this in his writings:</p>
<p>At Bollingen I am in the midst of my true life, I am most deeply myself &hellip; I have done without electricity, and tend the fireplace and stove myself. Evenings, I light the old lamps. There is no running water, and I pump the water from the well. I chop the wood and cook the food. These simple acts make man simple; and how difficult it is to be simple!</p>
<p>I want to tell you about a time I felt that. It was towards the end of my journey, sometime in April, when I worked on an island in Panama. One day the men left for mainland for some tools, and I stayed behind. I felt that excitement like when you have a big house to yourself. That night I made a fire on the east side of the island near the stucco frame house, which the men were making into a surfers&rsquo; hostel. I set up my pad by it and lay down. I wrote a little by the fire and listened to the waves below. They rasped when the tide sucked them in and sprayed upon the rock walls of the cliff. When I was little before I went to sleep I&rsquo;d have these images of being on a lifeboat on the slope of a wave that was gathering itself hundreds of feet into the air. The thought of waiting to die like that terrified me and I&rsquo;d lay pinned to my bed.</p>
<p>I felt something touch my sleeping bag. It was a blue crab about the size of my hand. It had those beady snail eyes. I got a saucepan from the house and trapped the crab beneath it. Then I used a spatula to scrape the crab into the pan. I poured oil on the pan and held it over the fire. The oil began to spit out of the pan, and the crab became a violent shiny red with blue-gray still on its edges and legs. I broke it apart with a rock and pulled out the soft white meat. It was sweet, salty, moist, and good because you had to work for it and because there was so little.</p>
<p>It was a small island on the Pacific coast of Panama. You could make a loop around the whole thing in an hour. It rose about twenty feet from the ocean, and a strip of white beach framed it like a moat. It was covered in dry forest, except where it had been cleared, and was somewhere between tropical and Mediterranean in vegetation and climate. It had the laziness of coastal Spain or Greece in its dryness and sunlight, but in May the rain began, and every day we had an afternoon shower. There were two dark and big avocado trees in the center of the island, close to the main hut. They were at least thirty feet high, and their leaves were purple and leathery. Hundreds of avocados in a tree like black jewels, big avocados like the ones they have in supermarkets. One of the trees bore fruit with darker, purple-green shells and it was creamier and softer than the fruit of the other tree, whose shells were smooth and green like zucchini and whose fruit was unripe. Scattered around the island were also four or five papaya trees. The trees were thin and only had a few leaves, and if you gave them time they swelled with a single melon-sized fruit that looked too heavy for its thin trunk, like a slender woman who&rsquo;s big with child. They were unripe if they were green and the same powdery color as their big star-shaped leaves, but when they became orange or yellow you tapped the fruit with a long pole so that it swayed and the weak stem gave. You had to catch the melon in your shirt and bring it quickly away from you to cradle it like a lacrosse stick or it would burst if it hit the ground. When you split the fruit there was the faint smell of bile, and its round black seeds gave you the feeling that they were swarming insects. But after you scraped them off you had the soft pink-red fruit whose belly was serrated and crystalline with sugar. The fruit was soft enough that it fell apart between your tongue and the roof of your mouth and went down like a sweet liquid. There was also an array of pineapple bushes, but they were too young to bear fruit, and there was a plantain grove whose trees were like stalks and under whose palm fronds were the green or yellow tooth-like rows of bananas. But they were thicker than bananas and tasted like their tart, dry ends until you fried them with oil and sugar. Then they softened and were filling like meat.</p>
<p>In the forest the leaves covered the ground so thickly that your feet sank to the shin like you were stepping into snow. When you cleared them away the bottommost leaves were disintegrated, only gray stems and veins like a fish plucked clean. The soil was black and moist like spent coffee grounds and every fistful of earth flashed and squirmed with insects in your palm. There were no animals larger than chickens on the island, no snakes, pigs, squirrels&mdash;I don&rsquo;t ever recall even seeing a rodent. I guess you&rsquo;d need to introduce them to the island, or they&rsquo;d have to stowaway for them to be there. It&rsquo;s nice to think about the island coming out of the ocean as cooling magma, then the first bird dropping seeds on it, and now it was covered with life and deep with it, too. And everything growing out of the remains of everything that died on it. I wondered how it was possible for the island to get more and more life and matter, and I figured it must be the work of millions of small birds. Seeds in their poop, insects for their young, fish and crabs washed up in the stink of low tide, rain every afternoon, sunlight&mdash;a handful of life arriving to the island every day for hundreds of thousands of years.</p>
<p>A stout, dark-skinned man named Tony owned the island. One of his calves was heavily scarred, nearly carved out. It was hairless from the scarring, knotted and shiny like a piece of polished wood as he dragged it behind him. But his eyes were kind, black and glittering like you always had an inside joke with him. He and two brothers were slowly transforming the island into a surfers&rsquo; hostel. I worked for six weeks under another man, an American named Richard, a tan and wiry man of 62 years with a dark hairy chest. Some part of his face or one of his limbs was always twitching, and he usually wore a scowl. So it was five men on that island, including me.</p>
<p>Every morning I got the same frayed rice sack from the main hut and went around the island picking fruit and collecting eggs. The hut was a primitive island structure, thatched and roofed with king palm fronds that were dry and yellow-gray with age. Inside were four bunks with green mosquito nettings, a chicken coop, and a long wooden counter overlooking the ocean, which served as our kitchen. There were some groceries from the mainland like vegetables, pasta, rice, cooking oil, and spices, and we cooked on a two-burner stove that was attached by a hose to a squat propane tank. We cooked with and drank from the rainwater that collected into a blue plastic garbage bin from the rain gutter of the main hut. The water was tart and slightly metallic. I drank it liberally. The two brothers fished often and would salt the perch and dry it out on the rock wall in front of the hut. The small cubes of rock salt looked tasty on the tan flesh that had in the sun shrunken beneath the spine and rib bones. The brothers spoke a quiet, mumbling Spanish that was incoherent to me and kept to themselves.</p>
<p>The south side of the island had dozens of coconut trees. You could go around picking up coconuts and shaking them to see if they had juice. The glossy green ones sloshed with more juice than the grey-brown ones, but the latter were sweeter. I got good at that two-part machete strike that would create a wedge into the shell for me to drink its juice. I&rsquo;d shake the juice out into a bowl, then I split the shell with an overhead strike and carved out the hard white meat with a spoon. Ants swarmed under me and bit my bare feet as juice and slivers of fruit ran down my front, and I would rub my feet over each other to lessen the sting.</p>
<p>To wash I would go into the ocean and rub sand into my skin and hair. The water was warm and shallow, the clear aqua that flashes with sunlight and means paradise. Then I would walk back up the carved stairs to the hut and rinse the salt off my skin with bowls of rainwater from the blue bin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes I went for a swim in the ocean. You could go far out because on the north side of the island where the skiff was moored, the waves were waist-high. But I wouldn&rsquo;t go too far. The shallowness continued for some length before it dropped off suddenly into a wasteland of powdery-gray detritus and narrow brown fish that picked at it and which darted when your shadow was on them. The gray pillowy floor was bare except for the fish, rocks, and brown seaweed about a foot high. The floor had a strange consistency, soft like river silt, but airy so that you could dig your hand deep into it, though it took me a lot of courage to do that. The sunlight was geometric here and cut cleanly toward the floor like prisms from the surface, which here were the heavens themselves. At this depth the weight of the ocean pressed on you and gave you the sharp pain in your ears which you squeezed out by holding your nose and snorting. The fear was there too, the prey feeling. Darkened the mind and the edges of your vision and you think there was a shark or a barracuda coming at you in your blind spots.</p>
<p>Tony had me restore the walkway to the frond-thatched hut, to dust and remove detritus from the stone-carved staircase up the cliff. There was a mound of about 100 clear glass bottles of Panamanian rum in the woods, and he wanted me to plant them bottom-up on the path between the hut and the hostel which was at the time only the two-bedroom stucco frame. The hostel was a half-mile away, on the other side of the island. After soaking them in soapy water I scraped off their labels with steel wool and gouged out the earth with a spade to plant them. Sometimes I took things like a generator or a small refrigerator by wheelbarrow between the hut and the hostel. The men were older than me and got tired quickly. They were digging a well on the east end of the island where the hostel was.</p>
<p>Tony had a boy who had come with us on the island on my first time. We&rsquo;d picked him up from school and drove through the night to the beach where the skiff was moored. We drove in a pick-up truck with three seats in the front, and the boy whose name wasn&rsquo;t Spanish but something long and indigenous, was sullen with me. Then some time later he decided that he liked me and he would shout my name whenever he arrived on the island. He would strip down to his white underwear and would stay like that until he left the island again He followed Tony or me around and would help me with my chores. There was a battered and flat ball in the hut, and we kicked it around. Sometimes when I walked the edge of the cliff I saw him swimming in the ocean. He showed me with a knife how to peel the green skin off the sugar cane and and bite it with the molars to release the juice and to suck on it until only the stringy pulp remained. He was confident with the knife and the machete that he brought down in one clean motion to cleave the cane off so that it was like an organ pipe, and he smiled as he sucked on his end of the cane. He was good and happy and he loved his father, and I avoided him.</p>
<p>Richard helped me put together a shelter on my first week on the island, on the cliff of one of the eastern points of the island. We carried a long bamboo rod to the site where it acted as a tarp pole. He let me borrow his tent, which I patched with duct tape. Richard had plotted out some land on the south side of the island where he was going to build a home. I offered to help him with it. We spent a few hours that day beachcombing for sea glass, uncracked shells, and polished pieces of driftwood. There were sizzling tufts of yellow sea foam and wobbly knobs of jellyfish pierced with sunlight. There were tire shavings, bottles of plastic and polished glass. The glass was dark amber, medicine blue, clear, and frosted, and there were the frayed remains of webbed lawn chairs, shoes, blue netting, aluminum cans, and rusty pieces of metal.</p>
<p>Richard and I met every half-hour to show each other what we had found. We spent most of our time at a distance with our attention at our feet and our eyes searching for any strange and man-made colors, shapes, and patterns. He was looking for the other mate of a pair of sandals. I returned all that I found to the sand in a small pile and looked with him. I realized that we wouldn&rsquo;t find pairs of any kind on this beach. But eventually I found an off-brand sandal for him that was the same size. We walked ankle-deep toward a smaller beach that could only be reached in the low tide. He said that everything we needed could be found on the shores of remote islands near America and that we didn&rsquo;t need to make anything anymore, except for food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did that to you?&rdquo; Richard asked me, clapping a pair of tongs at my thighs. &ldquo;Or what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were back at the main hut. He was frying some chopped plantains, and I was flouring some fish to deep-fry. The two brothers had brought back a lingcod and two rockfish from the rockier east-end of the island and filleted them, too. I cut the flesh into small, six-inch pieces. Then I patted them with some flour and dipped them into a bowl of whisked eggs. A saucepan of vegetable oil was heating on the burner beside the plantains, which were sizzling now and smelling sweet. The two brothers had returned from their fishing and were smoking quietly on the cliff before us. Tony was barefoot, hacking at sugar cane with a rusty machete just outside the hut. I told Richard what happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see that shit up close,&rdquo; he said, and I hiked up my shorts with my powdered hands. The scars were white and spidery against my darkened legs. They looked like I had done them to myself, and I remember that&rsquo;s what you thought on our way to Joshua Tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Motherfucker,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Good for you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Check out my moon,&rdquo; he said. He pulled up his shirt from the back. His back was dark, freckled, and wispy with blonde hair. There was a white hairless crescent about the width of three fingers below his shoulder blade. &ldquo;My old man gouged me out with one of them jumbo Jenga blocks one day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long story, my fault.&rdquo; He took a wrinkled, hand-rolled cigarette out of his pocket and lit the tobacco fibers poking out of it on the gas stove. It flared like a fuse toward the barrel of the cigarette. He took a long drag until the crimped tobacco glowed and snapped. &ldquo;Mostly,&rdquo; he said through a mouth of smoke. He offered me his pouch of tobacco, but I shook my head. &ldquo;I did a lot of martial arts when I was younger. Taekwondo, kung fu, jiu jitsu. Bruce Lee was my hero, of course. I respect Asians &lsquo;cus they&rsquo;re always about the hard way, the mental way. Maybe you got that in you, too. Have you seen that Tom Cruise picture, <em>Last Samurai</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember that scene when they&rsquo;re training?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No mind.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah man! <em>Exactly</em>.&rdquo; He banged the oily tongs on the wooden counter. &ldquo;&lsquo;No mind.&rsquo; &lsquo;No mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day while my dad was out, my mom was giving me flak for something I didn&rsquo;t do, some chore. I was coming up, you know, getting bigger and stronger every day. My dad was a big fitness nerd, former gymnast. When we lived in the San Juans he&rsquo;d do Imogene Pass every morning, rain or shine. That&rsquo;s about a mile-gain in elevation, hombre. He used to walk around our house on his hands like some master sensei. Went through a fuckton, too. Grew up in the middle of dust bowl Oklahoma. Parents dead before he was 15. Car crash. The fuck, right? Raised his sisters and brothers himself. Great Depression, all that. Killed a couple Krauts. Not D-day, but I think he rode into Berlin, smoking a cigar through the tank hatch. Might have liberated some stick-figure Jews, too. Fuck, man. That&rsquo;ll make or break you. Or both, like what happened with my dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The oil in the saucepan was bubbling now, and I used the tongs to lower the fish into it. The oil turned white and fizzled like poured soda, but it calmed in a few minutes. The fish became crip and golden-brown like fried chicken and filled the hut with a good smell. Tony poked his head in and smiled. I laughed to myself about how he looked with his grin and his machete in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lingcod!&rdquo; Richard shouted. &ldquo;Get your lingcod!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We took our plates with generous helpings of plantain, fish, and avocado and brought them over to the cliff beneath which were the steps to the beach. The heat of the day was giving way to the rain that came around five o&rsquo;clock every day now. The rain was warm and pleasant to walk around in. A few afternoons I&rsquo;d taken a swim in the ocean as it stormed and sat in the shallows to watch the murky gray-green horizon crack. A few days ago we tried to take the skiff to the mainland with two Americans who were there to surf. The gray ocean rolled us up and down as lightning grew down into the horizon like fine white roots. Richard and two Americans who were there to surf were under the blue canvas hood of the skiff. I sat shirtless at the bow. Richard offered me a jacket. I told him I was okay. The raindrops were many small slaps on my back. Like mosquitoes, I thought, but less needle-like. The boat crashed into the faces of waves and pointed skyward. The waves washed over us, and I licked my lips for the warm salt. I figured it wasn&rsquo;t a bad way to go and thought there was real beauty to our smallness within the ocean and the waves dimpled by the rain. Behind me they were shouting about gas and which way was north. Richard was going, &ldquo;Damn, had to be the ocean, huh?&rdquo; He put a hand on my shoulder and shouted in my ear to look for land. I nodded. I was in their hands now and we were in the hands of the ocean. Then the island appeared before us as a dark forested mound, and they laughed and clapped me on the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So my ma,&rdquo; he continued, a limp piece of steaming, flaked fish in his hand, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s in my room and giving me shit and I&rsquo;m giving it back, and she pushes me, catches me off-balance. It was almost instinct, man&mdash;but as I&rsquo;m falling backward, I kick up with my legs, kicked her right in the chest, and I remember the look of surprise on her face as she fell. Man. I ran away from home because I was so scared of what I did. Ended up calling my parents by the Greyhound to tell &lsquo;em I was sorry. I&rsquo;ll never forget what my dad said. He said: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no going back from what you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo; Scariest walk back home I&rsquo;ve ever had. Thought about hitchhiking and leaving my parents forever. Maybe I coulda gotten a headstart on building this house on this island. But yeah, my dad beat the fuck out of me when I got back home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the Jenga block?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. Yeah. No, that was actually a different time, when I pissed him off for acting out in school or something like that. He threw that shit at me as I was turning my back on him. Ripped a fucking hole in my shirt. Thought I got shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daddy beat me. A lot. <em>Man</em>. When you get hit you start to lie. You lie because look where being yourself got you. All shriveled up at the foot of your father. So you're like, &lsquo;this ain't me, this ain't me,&rsquo; and you lie to yourself about who you are and pretty soon you believe it. But inside you <em>know</em>, and you hate yourself for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it came time to get beat I&rsquo;d burst into tears and fucking go sulk for days afterward. It&rsquo;s not the pain, right? It&rsquo;s the idea that you could be the cause of so much hatred for your dad. Any love you got for the old man goes back to zero. Then it starts up again and <em>wham</em>. Zero. So why bother in the first place? I wanted to beat him by pretending to feel nothing, even to like it a little. You think if you don&rsquo;t retaliate you&rsquo;re due some credit for when you&rsquo;re older. And let me tell you, my man&mdash;I&rsquo;ve cashed out. Here I am, alone on this island. Wife&rsquo;s <em>afuera</em>!&rdquo; He backhanded the hair. &ldquo;Kids are God-knows-where.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll tell you how much I hated that motherfucker and my mama too for being weak in front of him. One day we were over at a friends'. I was wrestling around with the kids in the backyard. Rich fuckers, had a tennis court and a water slide for their goddamn pool. My mom comes in to tell us that daddy&rsquo;s sick, so we followed her up to the master bedroom. My dad's lying in their bed, looking yellow as I'd ever seen him. Turned out to be a tumor. But you know what I remember is seeing him all fucked up was one of my happiest memories with him. I crawled up onto the bed and fluffed his pillow and pulled the covers over him I was so happy. <em>What a nice son you&rsquo;ve raised,</em> the other mom said. Felt light, like I wouldn't have to walk on eggshells around him anymore the fucking bastard. I mean, what does a man get from conquering his kid? Every night before I went to sleep, the hate burning my eyeballs like acid, I told myself that one day I&rsquo;d leave and never speak to them again. Then they&rsquo;d wonder if I&rsquo;d still be around if they&rsquo;d given me a fucking <em>speck</em> of decency.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>He laughed suddenly. &ldquo;So here I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latter half of that April I spent shirtless and became as brown as the other men. Mosquito bites came and went on my back. At night after dinner and after the mosquitoes had left the stillness of the sunset I wrote and read by candlelight while the men rolled cigarettes and drank by the main hut. One night I was writing inside my tent. Sometimes the mosquitoes were escapable if you didn&rsquo;t netting. They weren&rsquo;t there where you were, but eventually they all figured out where you were. During the first half of my trip, all the way down the tail of Mexico, my arms and ankles were covered with mosquito bites. At night the heat of my sleeping bag would radiate onto my bites and activate them. Half-asleep and half-crazed in the ecstasy of it I would itch and itch, and in the morning my fingernails would be stuffed black and smell metallic. But here I was glad to finally have a home and be inside the mesh where the mosquitoes couldn&rsquo;t get to me and a tarp to keep me dry.</p>
<p>I had cut the top off a plastic soda bottle and put a candle inside. I used some of its hot wax to hold it in place.</p>
<p>Richard came by my tent and sat cross-legged in front of me. I saw through the mesh that he had a bottle of that white rum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you want we could build you a house, too. Right here. 12 by 12 by ... 10, or 12. Whatever you want. When the surfer hostel gets going we can go to mainland and advertise, bring &lsquo;em back here and get some commission ... I&rsquo;m thinking a lofted bed, could get you a propane tank and a stove. Make your morning coffee and look out at that.&rdquo; He gestured to the ocean. &ldquo;Think about it, think about it. La Isla de what?&rdquo; He smiled big. &ldquo;De Afuera!&rdquo; And he backhanded the air. &ldquo;<em>Afuera!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>I laughed and told him we could get started soon. He wanted to talk more, but I told him I was going to bed. He left, and I lay in my sleeping bag for some time. I thought about Alex, as I usually did before I went to sleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d had on my computer a video of Alex and me on a beach in Fort Bragg, California. We spent a weekend there at a bed and breakfast after I had worked there during the winter break of my sophomore year. One morning we walked a few miles along the sea cliffs. We crossed a long wooden bridge between two cliffs which lay over a shallow murky lake that carried into the ocean. There was a policeman wading slowly toward something under the bridge, and we leaned over the rail to see what it was. It was a dead man floating on his back.</p>
<p>The beaches of Northern California are not like the ones in Southern California. They&rsquo;re narrow and above them are wet and rocky cliffs and rock formations you climb down to get to the beaches. On the cliffs are meadows of green grass and yellow and white wildflowers, and there are also tall, skinny trees that are bedheaded from the cold sea winds and gesture inland. The water is so cold that it feels like it&rsquo;s bruising your bones from the inside. The waves have bored holes in some of the outcroppings of rock and have made arches and islands. Some of the islands are flat and have fresh grass and wildflowers upon them. At first you think there&rsquo;s also trash on these islands, and you wonder how someone had swam and scaled its walls which are 20 feet high. But then you see a lot of seagulls with red dipped on their yellow beak tips coming back and forth toward the island like it&rsquo;s a rotting whale, and you realize that it isn&rsquo;t trash. It&rsquo;s the black and white downy feathers of their young. You want to climb onto the island and lie on the grass because you know that no one else has ever been there. On the beaches are dark green and rubbery kelp, hollow yellow-brown bulbs, white driftwood, and the fishy decay of jellyfish and seashells. When the tide ebbs, the water sizzles and bubbles over the coarse sand like spit on the mouth of a crab, and the rounded glass and pebbles crunch underfoot, such as when you dig your hand into a jar of marbles.</p>
<p>She is running ahead of me, dancing just beyond the last unfoldings of waves along the sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No rules,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;No rules!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>She is wearing a black hoodie with a white zipper, blue jeans, and gray Converse sneakers. She is wearing her black-framed glasses that are big for her face. Her black hair is rich and mane-like and begins at her widow&rsquo;s peak and reaches the middle of her back. I have spent many nights with my nose in its roots. An old pair of leather binoculars from the inn hang from her neck, as they do on mine. They are heavy and cloudy, and we have brought them for show. I am laughing as I record her, thinking about how we will watch this video in the future after we have spent many years away from each other, after we realize that in spite of having met when we were so young, we hadn&rsquo;t yet met anyone like the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re taking advantage of &lsquo;No Rules,&rsquo;&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>Then she lopes sideways towards me to avoid the lens. I lower it and we embrace.</p>
<p>What a photo or a video can do is anchor a memory, like a historical fact. It can keep it from wear or corruption. And when you look at it after many years, after the bramble of memory has obscured it, the truth emerges. We should be suspicious of our memories because I read that every act of remembrance alters the memory itself, like a game of telephone. But a memory feeds on remembrance, so either way it&rsquo;s doomed.</p>
<p>That video of Alex on the beach is gone now. Before leaving for my trip I erased it from my computer because I wanted to feel something. I did, I felt a stupid kind of loss. And now she&rsquo;s leaving my head, losing dimension. That makes me kind of sad. But grateful too, that a memory has a half-life, but that the way she made me feel will live as long as I do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a photo from that weekend, too. I remember the nonchalant way that she gave it to me after she&rsquo;d had the roll developed, like I could take it or leave it. I think she wanted me to take it. We&rsquo;re in our room in the old water tower. It was one of the nicer rooms in the small boutique hotel. I think it was called the Raven Room. I remember that I&rsquo;d tried to get the heater to work, but I just couldn&rsquo;t figure it out. So it was pretty cold. I remember grabbing her disposable camera from the small round table and snapping her without thinking. She&rsquo;s sitting like The Thinker, but she&rsquo;s leaning back in her chair. On the table before her are two fat wine glasses filled with a hangover&rsquo;s worth of cheap white wine, a harmonica, and an old herb jar full of bush weed I had gotten from Steve, the inn&rsquo;s maintenance man. One of her arms is across her belly, and her fist is up to her chin. Her bra is black and her underwear is pink. If I were to slip that photo in these pages, right here, so that as you opened to it you saw the slight defensiveness in her hard dark eyes and the pale skin of her thighs, then it goes without saying that you would pass over my description in favor of the photo itself. She&rsquo;d come alive to you. Eight years later and I&rsquo;m looking at that photo on my desk right now. Makes me think: Yes, that is what it was like.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>CHAPTER 9</p>
<p>I REMEMBER IN HIGH SCHOOL once when we were working on the newspaper, she came in to deliver some photos of hers. It was a Saturday morning. She had just come back from the beach. She was wearing a spring-green dress, and she glowed in the shy and generous way that a girl does when she considers that she might be beautiful. I looked and looked at her from behind my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember when she told me that her mother went through depression when she was little. One day her grandmother died and she saw her mom crying by her bed. She went to her and cried with her.</p>
<p>Her father once told her that he was going to run an errand, and she asked him if she could go along. I'm not sure how old she was. Three, four, five. She ended up looking at an apartment with him, and it wasn&rsquo;t until she was older that she realized how close her parents' marriage was to coming undone.</p>
<p>I know that her sister and her mother used to fight a lot, and I know she doesn&rsquo;t raise her voice to anyone.</p>
<p>I remember the way she was looking at me at that party in the summer after high school. I was drunk for the first time in my life, and only had on my friend&rsquo;s swim trunks which were really big on me. She was looking at me like I was good, like I could be what she was looking for. But there was something sad about her eyes too that didn&rsquo;t have to do with me. I didn&rsquo;t know that at the time, but now I do.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d talk for hours almost every night after that party. I remember knowing that I loved her. I was eighteen, but I knew. It&rsquo;s 11:11, she said once. Make a wish. I told her I wished that I&rsquo;d taken her to Senior Ball when she&rsquo;d asked me. I asked her what she wished for. She said she wished things were different, but she couldn't say why.</p>
<p>One time my sophomore year I got two free tickets from one of my classes to see a reading of two well-known writers in San Francisco. We drank before, on the way, during, and I loved her that night. When we got there she told me she needed to pee and we both stumbled into the bathroom. I&rsquo;m peeing in front of you, she said, and I supposed she&rsquo;d never done that before and I loved her that night.</p>
<p>We passed that bottle of vodka and juice back and forth as we sat in the back. She always drank better than me. The gray-haired moderator was talking about how their books had really similar themes even though they were super different. I turned to her and whispered <em>he&rsquo;s just jacking them off</em> and I motioned like I was giving her a handjob and she tilted her head back and groaned throatily and we laughed. She was always quick like that. On our way to the station she said <em>Brian</em>. Then she looked around and opened her jacket. She was wearing an oversized bomber jacket over a seafoam-green strapless dress, and she whispered <em>remember how I told you I was having problems with my dress</em> and she opened it. Not seductively, but like a kid to a kid, and her boobs were peering out from over the cups of her dress. Right on the corner of Van Ness and something. I told her I didn&rsquo;t see what the problem was and pretended to reach for them like a zombie and she laughed.</p>
<p>While we were waiting for the train to take us home I remember that she looked at me in this almost complete adoration. It was too much for me so I looked away. I asked her how her legs were doing in the cold, one ankle up, en pointe and pestling into the ground like she needed to pee. She said she just being a little jittery and she looked at me again with that look but it was sheepish, too. I realized that she thought I had asked her <em>what are you doing</em> so I said <em>no, I meant how are you doing, it&rsquo;s so cold</em> and she said <em>ohh</em> and her sheepishness went away and she said <em>nuuthing</em> and it was that look again, and I had to look away again.</p>
<p>And I remember the last time I saw her too, couple months after all this. She was home for Christmas, and she hit me up. I was living at my parents&rsquo;, and she picked me up and we talked the whole night as we sat in her car at a park. There was a long time where we sat with our faces in the dark, not saying a word. Just trying to make sense of everything. We hung out a couple days later. I thought it was so strange that you could do the same things with another person that you did a couple years back when you loved each other, but feel like this time you were with a stranger.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t wouldn&rsquo;t turn the car off when she dropped me off. She started to cry silently, and I heard her tears thud on my windbreaker. I asked her in the wrong voice why she was crying. She said it was for those times past that we could never get back, and I went home and hit my desk and also cried. A couple months later I decided to go and see her in Seattle. I hitchhiked there from Big Sur. Got a really bad case of poison oak all over my body trying to bushwhack my way through the overgrown trail, spent the coldest night of my life on the Lost Coast Trail after I fell into a river, and got a ride with a bunch of hippies up to Arcata. Spend a day hitching up to Eugene with an old guy named Jimmy who looked like Fidel Castro. We slept in the stall of a bathroom at a rest stop that night because it was so cold outside. Then it was a straight shot from Portland to Seattle, and I got a bus to her place. We walked around a big green lake by her house. She said that sometimes you could see orcas surface in it. I told her that it was like we lived in different worlds, and she laughed. It was the morning, but we brown-bagged a couple 40s and drank on a park bench. We went with her friends to a bar that night. I remember we were by the pool table and her best friend saying, I never know what&rsquo;s really going on with her. Me too, I said. We spent the night on the couch of her friend. My face was on her chest. I asked her if she wanted to get back together, and I closed my eyes. I felt her chest rise and fall. No.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re my favorite, she whispered, and she kissed me around my face. That made me cry. Then she left, before it was even light out, and I never saw her again.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>CHAPTER 10</p>
<p>TOWARD THE END of my stay we went into the mainland in the skiff. Richard wanted to catch up with some of his friends. I also knew he wanted to get laid.</p>
<p>His battered green jeep was by the dock. We drove for about a half hour down the coast to his house with cans of beer in our laps. We followed a gravel road through a neighborhood of large houses, most of which he said belonged to American expats. Richard told me how the owners of these homes had made their money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This guy started breeding, like, short, squat coconut trees so you can pick the nuts easier. Rolling in it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hotels, man. Resorts all up and down the coast. Chiriqui, Boca Negra and shit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We passed by a panader&iacute;a, an old hardened woman stared at Richard as we drove by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She and I had a long conversation in the hopes of reconciliation,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And we came to the conclusion that she was a sour cunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We pulled into his driveway. Richard was three beers in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s light stuff,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Literally cannot fuck you up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His small two-room house had bats. They fluttered like jagged pieces of black cloth that changed in size as they moved from rafter to rafter. They blocked the light and put shadows on the wall. His home had the earthy and urine-like odor of bat feces, and the linens on the bed he let me sleep on were dusted with it. His bathroom had black mold in the corners. The toilet seat had a broken hinge and was yellowed and peeling, and the hole in the wall of the shower was plugged with a green soda bottle that let in a fractured green light. What appeared to be soil, but what I later realized were the feces, was scattered on the concrete floor. Molding dishes covered in these feces filled his sink, all of his kitchen&rsquo;s countertops, and the floor around. I spent a few hours cleaning his kitchen while Richard visited his friends. My pruny hands glowed with heat from the harsh soap. After I finished I walked around the neighborhood hoping to find a pick-up game of soccer. But there was nothing going on, and I spent a few hours walking along the beach which was soft with yellow palm fronds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I went to bed I put on a long-sleeved shirt and pants within my sleeping bag and slept with my hood because of the bats.</p>
<p>Around midnight he woke me up and told me to come with him to the local bar on the beach. I came, though I knew he only wanted me to so I could help him get a girl. He was already drunk, and he wanted to drive there. I told him I would walk there myself. Suit yourself, he said. He drove into a ditch just ahead of me. We walked together. There were a few local men at the bar. They were grinning at the two women there. They crooned to the music and shuffled their feet. Richard brought me over to the younger of the women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;El es muy inteligente,&rdquo; he shouted over the music. It was the raucous Mariachi type.</p>
<p>She smiled politely at me.</p>
<p>I left and went to bed.</p>
<p>Hours later I heard the front door open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brian!&rsquo; Richard shouted. &ldquo;We have guests!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ignored him and went back to sleep with earplugs.</p>
<p>&hellip;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the morning there was broken glass on his porch. The outdoor table was shattered, and there was blood smeared on the ground. Richard was smoking on a chair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a long drag and flicked the butt onto the grass. &ldquo;Brought back some friends from the bar, guy and a girl. Girl would only come on condition that guy would, so fuck it&mdash;we all came back here. You were knocked out. Go back to my room and start up a porno in my bed. Missionary, doggy shit. Nothing fucked up. Everything&rsquo;s going swell until the man starts groping the woman. Grabbing her tits, pinching her ass, pulling her hair. &lsquo;<em>Puta, Puta.&rsquo;</em> So I grab the fucker by the seat of his pants and drag him outside. Put his face through the glass table and stomp on his head a couple times to put some sense in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he now?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Took off like a bitch. Left some teeth, too. <em>Man</em>. Mood dead, girl gone. I didn&rsquo;t even get to fuck her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he asked me for help in jacking his car out of the ditch, I told him that since he had gotten himself into that ditch, he could get himself out of it. He stared at me. Then he quietly resumed his work.</p>
<p>I read on his porch for a bit then left to visit Richard&rsquo;s friend, Chuck, a Texan expatriate, to see if I could use his internet connection. When I returned to Richard&rsquo;s after the sun had gone down I found that the front door was locked. So I set up camp on his porch and waited for him to come. When he did late into the night I greeted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cocksucker,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You think you can just leave, like just fucking get up and <em>go</em>&mdash;well, what the fuck am I supposed to do&mdash;am I just supposed to carry on with my fucking <em>day</em>? I hired you to work for me, motherfucker. You're mine. You're supposed to be at my every beck and <em>call</em>, you coddled piece of shit. You probably had your mom make your bed for you every morning, you freeloading motherfucker. You never worked a goddamn <em>day</em> in your life, you fucking kid, you selfish fuck. You're only thinking about yourself, that's all you ever fucking do&mdash;how do I promote myself, how do I manipulate people to like me. You'll be successful but you'll be so fucking alone because no one wants to be around selfish pricks like you and you think you're so fucking smart but guess what, motherfucker&mdash;<em>I'm smarter than you</em>&mdash;I've been around for forty <em>fucking</em> years longer than you and you're a dumb motherfucker. You didn&rsquo;t even know what the fuck was going when we almost died on that boat! I saw you, you fucking fool. You were out of your fucking head on that boat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Your parents fucked up, your brother and your sister fucked up, and there's no fucking hope for you. If my kids ever acted like you I'd beat them into the fucking ground. At three, <em>at three fucking years of age</em>, my son and my daughter fucking outshined you, you disrespectful piece of shit. Don't you fucking judge me&mdash;yeah I know you fucking judge me, the way you look at me and the way you use your goddamn <em>tone</em> with me, I see you writing in your little fucking diary about me. You think I'm fucking a&mdash;<em>a drunk and a loser</em>. Well you're a goddamn sociopath. You just stand there, you remorseless fucker&mdash;is anything I'm saying even reaching you? What did I do to you to make you hate me? Well, fuck you. <em>Fuck. You</em>. You're never coming back to the island&mdash;all your stuff's gone, that shelter&rsquo;s <em>mine</em> now&mdash;because I don't want you manipulating anyone, I don't want you near the clients 'cus you'll just manipulate your way into getting them to do whatever you want. I don't ever want to see you again. Ciao! <em>Ciao!&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>We went back to the island the next day. For the next three days I lived in a hell. On the skiff ride to the island Richard told me he would kill me if I tried to &ldquo;fuck with Tony or with him.&rdquo; I asked him if he was serious. Yeah, you dumb motherfucker. I worked as I normally did in the daytime, but I also sharpened a long branch into a spear and kept it by my new shelter, which I made in the forest on the island&rsquo;s west side. The boy found me and helped me tie the fly down, and then he ran off into the woods. I carried a few rocks in my pocket. I did push-ups, dips, sit-ups, and chin-ups off tree branches. At night under a leaking rain fly I had found in the hut, drops of water thudded on my forehead and mosquitoes for my skin, and I listened for him to come. If I have to kill him, I thought, I&rsquo;ll kill him.</p>
<p>The morning we left I went into his bag and among empty prescription bottles of lithium I found his passport. I was going to bury it or throw it off the island, but I decided not to. Instead I went into his journal, in which was written:</p>
<center><p>Locate saw near plot.</p>
<p>Begin staking land out.</p>
<p>Help Brian with shelter.</p></center>
<p>In his penmanship I wrote sporadically throughout the journal:</p>
<center><p>Where is my family?</p>
<p>Where are my friends?</p>
<p>Am I alone?</p>
<p>Where has my memory gone?</p>
<p>I am going to die alone, and no one will know that I did.</p>
<p>Out of lithium &hellip; think I&rsquo;m going crazy &hellip;</p></center>
<p>Then I went to the shelter on the cliff over the sea. I was going to rip apart his tarp and his tent with a knife, but I didn&rsquo;t. I only threw the bamboo rod off the cliff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tide was up to the steps on the cliff. The waves were foamy and yellow-gray. Tony kayaked to the anchored skiff to bring it closer to shore. He hovered it as closely as he could without scraping the rudder on the sand. Richard and I waded out toward them with our backpacks above our heads. We climbed with our elbows over the side of the boat. We motored a few miles over the sea toward the small bay. The low green trees grew up to the shore and the lake-waves lapped at their roots and trunks. Tony slowed the skiff when we entered an inlet. We hummed through the still water for a few more minutes. When we were close to the small beach that opened just a few feet to the road Tony killed the motor and motioned to me with the mooring line. We continued to move slowly toward the shore. I took off my shirt and my sandals and slid into the dark green water and swam with my head dry toward the beach. I felt with my toes a cold black current and tasted the freshwater. The boy dove in behind me with a shout. I hitched the line to the thick trunk of a tree whose branches hung over the water and began slowly to pull the boat toward me. The boy climbed the tree with his foot on the rope and leaped off it. He swam in the shadow of the tree and spat water out of his mouth. I wanted to tell him that this was the last time I would see him. Instead I walked up the gravel beach onto the road and began south. Some rain had come, and the asphalt was moist and crunchy and had the bitter scent of wet soil. I had with me four big avocados from the good tree. They were dark and firm and gave like clay when you pressed into them. The air was new and cool, and I felt that brief virtue as you do when you begin on the road again after a long time. Then it was a matter of waiting for my flight out. I spent a night in a large concrete pipe outside of a strip mall. It was a good place to sleep because one end was blocked by a perpendicular pipe. I lit a citronella candle to ward off mosquitoes, and the light was alive on the walls of the pipe like fire on the wall of a cave. The next day I got to a hostel on the Atlantic side of Panama to see if I could work there. It was night when I got there. In the common area, which was like a large gazebo, old Americans were jamming and shouting into the mike while a few Latinos laughed and teetered with them. I told the girl who worked there that I didn&rsquo;t have any money but would work. She gave me some sheets and told me to take one of the bunks in the hostel and that we would talk in the morning. She was pretty and had big brown eyes. Sometime in the night one of the old Americans came in and shined his light on my face for some time while he and the girl whispered. I kept my eyes closed. In the morning before anyone woke I went back to Panama City. The young black man who gave me a ride there said I could sleep at his home. When we got there at night he went inside to talk to his mother. He said I could sleep outside their apartment. Then at the airport I found some earbuds on the seat next to me. I went to the bathroom, sat on the toilet and listened to a song.</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>CHAPTER 11</p>
<p>THERE WAS A GIRL coming toward me. She must have been there to check out the black-out, too. She was cute, with brown hair that came down to her shoulders. Her hair looked really soft and healthy. It kind of reminded me of that haircut girls had during the World Wars, English or French girls with berets and stockings and satchels running during an air raid. Just a black turtleneck and tight black jeans that fit real well, and some red lipstick. She had a black Casio that was facing inside. She had great legs and a great butt, too, which she knew because her turtleneck was tucked into her jeans. She looked like she knew a lot about one of the visual arts, like photography or film. You could tell by her eyes, the way they were open and hopeful and shiny, that she was curious about what kind of world you lived in.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s coming my way and we both look at each other longer than usual because we know we got something in common. The way she looks at me, it&rsquo;s with those kind of wide eyes where you know a girl is interested in you. I was probably giving her the same look, too, because she blushed a little, you know like when someone looks at you for too long and you lose your composure. We both slowed down near each other, and I don&rsquo;t know why but I just kept walking past her, even though we&rsquo;d just pretty much just said that we were into each other. Moments like that, man, they hit you, they shake you. But I&rsquo;ll tell you the reason I didn&rsquo;t make a move, and that&rsquo;s because a couple weeks ago I was at this party. It was Eric&rsquo;s party. He was living at this new house with some cool people who were into the cutting edge of new music, you know, the kind of people who have religious experiences listening to hip hop albums and know all the gossip in the music world. They even had a name for their house, Carleton House, because that was the name of the street they were on. Anyway, first night I went over to them with a handle of rum, and I was my good self. Making good jokes, making people happy, not being excessive. That&rsquo;s my problem: I got a good first impression. It&rsquo;s the second and third where I always mess it up by going too far. For now, these guys were cool with me. One of them even told me that I had a &ldquo;good handle over my drunk self.&rdquo; But they were smart, too, of course. One of them was working with Stephen Hawking or something before he died. There were a couple reasons I fell out with them, and with Eric, too. The biggest reason is probably that I was an unlikable person who had a hard time keeping his mouth shut. One time that they were having a kickback, and the bathroom was full so I pissed out their kitchen window. Eric told me to go home. Another time on my birthday Eric took me to a show for this one electronic musician. It was a very nice thing for him to do, and he drove us all the way to Oakland for it. On our way home he used the word &ldquo;retarded,&rdquo; and then he apologized for it. I asked him why he was apologizing. He said that word wasn&rsquo;t okay now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Retard, cunt, bitch, pussy, faggot, nigger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>I said it again. We drove home in silence, and things weren&rsquo;t the same after that.</p>
<p>Anyway, before this fall-out they had this one friend named Marissa who&rsquo;d come over a lot. Man, prettiest girl I&rsquo;ve ever seen at Cal. So pretty that I already knew her face before I met her. I always thought it was a good day when I saw her around on campus. Half-Asian, kind of girl whose face you wouldn&rsquo;t change a thing about. Everyone&rsquo;s got a type, and she was it. She looked cool, too, always looking like she had something important to do. Anyway, they had this party one night, and I saw her in the kitchen. We got to talking. I don&rsquo;t even remember what we talked about except that it was all jokes, nothing serious, and everything was hitting. Man, you know that feeling when you&rsquo;re buzzed and talking to a great girl and making her laugh? Man, that was that night. I remember she even said during our conversation: &ldquo;Hey, I like you!&rdquo; Not in a romantic way, but that I was <em>in</em>.</p>
<p>But then this black guy came into the conversation, says hi and introduces himself. Marissa asks him where he's from. Brooklyn, he says. Then she gets all shy like he&rsquo;s just said he&rsquo;s James Baldwin&rsquo;s godson, and she asks him if he doesn&rsquo;t mind her asking him about Brooklyn. The guy grins at me and they start a Q&amp;A about his damn city. This guy, man, he went to Harvard and was going to start law school at Boalt. Guy was 30. So all the while he&rsquo;s giving us this talk I&rsquo;m thinking: this old bastard, coming in and poaching at a college party. So I drank some more, figured the night wasn&rsquo;t a total loss, and Eric walked me home.</p>
<p>Couple weeks later those guys had a Fourth of July party. It was just after Germany beat Brazil 7-1 in the World Cup semifinal, and I was walking back from Pappy&rsquo;s to their place on Telegraph. That&rsquo;s when I saw Marissa again, wearing red, white, and blue. I was thinking that today I was going to make my move. But I never really got the chance because I was being a coward. Instead what I was doing was looking at her every chance I got. I knew the way I was looking at her. Maybe you&rsquo;ve seen girls look at you like that, too, like how they could give up everything and go live in your world, how you could save them till they died. She&rsquo;d look at me, too, and look away. Couple days later I was asking about her to Eric.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She thinks you&rsquo;re kinda creepy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Damn, I thought. Damn.</p>
<p>But I got another little confession to make, which is that one day I saw Marissa come out of Dwinelle. I noted the time and date&mdash;1:30, Tuesday&mdash;and figured she had the same class on Thursday. You know how the scheduling works here, Monday/Wednesday, Tuesday/Thursday. So I walked around inside Dwinelle, that maze. Damn, I even dressed up a little. Anyway, I&rsquo;m walking downstairs, and there she is coming up. We both stop suddenly and stand there.</p>
<p>I have to go to class, she says.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what was in my head when I walked past that girl. Shit, sometimes late at night you think about stuff like that and you want to dig a deep hole and spend the rest of your life down there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But then I was running back to where I saw that girl. Running past VLSB and down onto that intersection on Oxford where those restaurants and ice cream shops are. Gone. Things like that, those missed connections, they haunt you for life. I turned back and started walking back up campus. All I could think about were her eyes and her ass and how I could have built my life around them.</p>
<p>Man, I was thinking about how there was no going back to just talking to a girl and not thinking about having her. It was either yes or no and if it was yes then you gotta start playing the game, and if no then you didn&rsquo;t want to be around her. I&rsquo;m thinking your friend&rsquo;s dad was right when he said don&rsquo;t get to fifty because then you can&rsquo;t fall in love anymore. I&rsquo;m thinking there&rsquo;s a reason you and I would rather have daughters than sons, why in the movies you always got the cold-blooded guy who&rsquo;s killed a lot of people and drinks a lot, and then a little girl comes his way, and he ends up loving her and protecting her with his life. He always dies in the end because there&rsquo;s no going back for him, no way he can unsee and undo everything. But the little girl, he can see that she&rsquo;s still pure and good, and he&rsquo;ll do anything to make sure she stays that way. I guess being boys, you know that getting messed up is inevitable, because I&rsquo;m telling you, sometimes I feel like a slave to it. Man, if someone told me he could take it away for good, I might just do it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m saying that if you get a kid, boy or girl, you have to take them away from the city and go to the mountains where there&rsquo;s no internet. I&rsquo;m serious. Make sure they don&rsquo;t forget their definitions. I guess the most important thing is don&rsquo;t have kids unless you have the right definitions, unless you love life. Be there for your kid, man, don&rsquo;t leave him all burnt in the sun, and don&rsquo;t say that you did all you could&mdash;if the kid&rsquo;s alive then it&rsquo;s not too late&mdash;and don&rsquo;t make him hate his life so bad that he kills himself. And don&rsquo;t leave your wife either&mdash;that promise is for life, not a couple years. Don&rsquo;t leave her to kill herself, and don&rsquo;t say that bullshit that you did everything you could. Anyway, raise your kid to be a giver, not a taker. City&rsquo;s a dangerous place to be because everyone&rsquo;s got the same wrong definitions&mdash;you can just tell by the way they look you up and down, always thinking about if you&rsquo;re better or they are. That&rsquo;s the pastime of city people, evaluating people, feeling smug if they&rsquo;re above you and anxious if they&rsquo;re below. Lot of fear. No one&rsquo;s got the right eyes in the city, you know those glittery eyes you see in children and dogs? Those shiny smiling eyes, man, that mean you&rsquo;re full of love. In the city people make their eyes cold&mdash;I figure they&rsquo;re protecting themselves from being hurt. And don&rsquo;t send your kid to a goddamn school either&mdash;you&rsquo;d trust some stranger to have better definitions than you? Man, school&rsquo;s where a kid goes to die. I bet most of the teachers you had were people who were doing the minimum of what they could do without getting fired. I had this one teacher named Mr. F. Had him for 10th grade English. We didn&rsquo;t learn a goddamn thing that whole year. We just dicked around. This one time my friend Michael was sitting in the front row with his Gameboy playing Pokemon with the sound on. F&rsquo;s talking, and Michael&rsquo;s going click, click, click. Finally he goes, Michael, please. Michael says, I have to beat this boss, Mr. F, it&rsquo;s really important. F sighs and says, Okay, just turn off the volume. Another time we tried to order a pizza to our classroom, like my friend Nate was calling the pizza guy on his phone, saying, you know, four pepperoni, four meatlovers, two dozen wings. In the end, Mr. F vetoed the whole thing, and we grumbled the whole week. Man, at the time I thought I&rsquo;d lucked out getting him because I didn&rsquo;t have to do shit to get an A in his class. But looking back, man, that guy was committing a real crime. You got a whole year to show kids why you think reading books is important, and you don&rsquo;t. Four English teachers in four years, and only one of them gave half a shit. The rest dicked us around.</p>
<p>I want to tell you about Aashik&rsquo;s grandpa who died pretty recently. Aashik and his family went to the funeral, I think it was in South India, Bangalore, where he was from. He says he was really shocked by how many people came to pay their respects. Thousands of people, from all over. Even an MP came in his helicopter with a bunch of bodyguards. I asked him what the hell his grandpa did. I was thinking he was a big shot businessman or something. Aashik said he was just the guy in his village that everyone would go to talk to when they needed advice. He was from a low caste, too. But he helped a lot of people out, including that MP before he was an MP. The way Aashik was talking about all the people there he had this really faraway look in his eyes. You could tell he was really proud of his grandpa and I bet he was thinking about how he wanted to be like him too someday. Man, someone like him that you could just go and talk to? Wise man of the village? A shepherd, man, a catcher.</p>
<p>Another thing I want to tell you about Aashik. Sometimes at night I&rsquo;d see him kneeling on his bed. His eyes would be closed and his hands would be clasped in his lap, praying. I asked him once what he prayed about. He said he prayed for the people in his life and for me, too, that I&rsquo;d find my way soon. I told myself I&rsquo;d do whatever I could to keep the guy as my friend.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>CHAPTER 12</p>
<p>&ldquo;YOU CAN&rsquo;T BE HERE,&rdquo; says a guy with a flashlight. He&rsquo;s wearing one of those campus security uniforms. We were by the grand entrance of Haas. When I was in high school my brother gave me a little tour of the school after I got in. We'd stood in front of that entrance. This was before the remodel, and I don&rsquo;t remember much about what it looked like except that I think it was more rustic, a little shabby. It was night then, and there&rsquo;d been fog around the lights of the lamp posts. There&rsquo;d been something really impressive about the business school, like really important stuff went on in there. Looking up at it and being a kid, I thought: &ldquo;Man, what the hell do you learn about in there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>"Can you see yourself going here?" He asked me.</p>
<p>"Yeah, maybe."</p>
<p>Then sometime when we were in school Haas got remodeled to look like a ski resort. I don&rsquo;t know if it was Aashik or my brother who told me this, but all the Haas buildings get repainted every year. It sure looks that way to me. Some of the buildings&rsquo; exteriors are lined horizontally from top to bottom with wood, you know, to give it some texture, but they&rsquo;ve been re-painted it the same beige-taupe so many times that the paint&rsquo;s caked over those lines. It reminds you of a woman who&rsquo;s put foundation over her wrinkles.</p>
<p>I nodded at the security guard and pointed up toward Gayley, toward the stadium. I continued that way till I was walking past Unit 2 when I thought about going into the courtyard. I don&rsquo;t know how well you remember it, but we were in Davidson, floor six. If you&rsquo;re coming out of Davidson, on your right you&rsquo;ll see a building called Towle, and that&rsquo;s for kids who transferred from a junior college. I went to the glass door that leads to the mailroom and stood there, between two trees in concrete flower beds, right on the intersection of these four concrete squares. Then I looked up. Reason was, freshman year a kid named Henry Treadway unscrewed his window from its frame. Then he jumped out and landed right where I was standing.</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s the spot because the next morning all the yellow tape was gone, and there was a Hispanic lady mopping up right there. She had her back to me, and I was trying to get a look at the spot to see if there was any blood there. But she was pretty much finished. She saw me in the glass door. Her eyes got big and she turned around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your friend?&rdquo; She whispered.</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>She nodded and stood there for a couple seconds. Then she got back to mopping.</p>
<p>I was thinking it would have been nice of her to leave some blood on the concrete.</p>
<p>I remember seeing Henry almost every night before he killed himself. He was always smoking in the courtyard on one of those benches by the bike cage. I was seeing a girl named Kari at the time who lived in Ehrman, so we were always walking back and forth across the courtyard. When I think about Henry I think about him in his light blue jacket. I think it was the warm-up jacket for Argentina&rsquo;s soccer team. I think about the flame of his lighter making his face glow red and the eyes he always gave me. Something bad in them, like he knew something about me that Kari didn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t like being cute with Kari around him because he&rsquo;d always give me those eyes with the beginning of a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's our friend, Camus,&rdquo; I always said to her when we saw him. I remember making jokes to her that he was going to buy a gun and go berserk one day.</p>
<p>The night he jumped, Alan, Emmylou, and I went for a walk to smoke a joint. When we got back there was an ambulance and yellow tape all over the entrance to Towle.</p>
<p>Man, maybe he wasn&rsquo;t so different from you or me. He probably messed around in high school like you and had to go to community college. Then he got into Cal, and his mom was saying that they always knew he was the brainiac in the family, and in their heads the rest of his life just unrolled before him&mdash;major in philosophy, get into law school, etc. But it&rsquo;s not that simple. I think about you telling me how you were the valedictorian of your class at community college, and how you gave the speech at graduation. And then how a semester in&mdash;floor six, Davidson&mdash;you were peeing into bottles because you couldn&rsquo;t leave your room, and you had to withdraw for a while. Not that simple. There&rsquo;s the fact that you have to live through every minute of every day with the disease of the knowledge inside you. If you were me, you liked to plan and make lists&mdash;the dozen journals you&rsquo;ve kept since you were sixteen because you decided you were going to become <em>a writer</em> are filled mostly with the prestige you hoped to have in ten years. You want to burn, quietly, lastingly, like you were walking a long journey to deliver lost children to their parents. But every minute of every day passes you by like you're running away from someone in a dream. You can't grip the ground, you seem to bounce. Your punches seem to take place underwater. One day you find the solution&mdash;it&rsquo;s your own little pet you keep in your coat pocket. You feed it and pet it and watch it grow. One evening, sunset, you go to the benches by the bike cage for a smoke like you do every night. See that one dumb Asian guy dicking around with his friends, only this time you don&rsquo;t wish upon him the things inside you. Then you go back to the room that you have to share with kids who don't get it, a room that you&rsquo;ve taken out a big loan to pay for because it costs you two grand a month to share it with another grown man who talks to his long-distance girlfriend every night under his sheets. You wonder if that debt is real or if it&rsquo;s more like a cancer that&rsquo;ll form within you in your fifties. You remember how you used to sit by the creek with the red-orange crawfish and the gangly tadpoles and how you&rsquo;d stroke the moss by you, lost in the thought that it might be the canopy of a miniature forest, under which were miniature jaguars and poison dart frogs and pyramids made of gold. When you were little, you always thought there was more to something than there really was. You believed in the whole universe that movies and books created. But when you got older you saw that only slices of it had been created. You believed for example that you could nestle in the beauty of a girl forever, but now you wonder if it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before you feel like you&rsquo;re cellmates with her. Man, you&rsquo;d give anything to go live in that dream&mdash;waking up cold at night next to her and the no-better rightness of the sleepy ache as you fit your limbs into hers, then the cabin and the stove and the snow that makes your face sting and your thoughts clean, then the fold between the fat wrists and fists of your children and the pride of being a father&mdash;</p>
<p>Sit there for a while.</p>
<p>So you jump, man, right from the sixth floor. You see the ground come at you way too quickly, a bark escapes your throat, you land on your neck and lie there broken, all your joints pointing the wrong way like a goddamn Picasso. What are you thinking about? Hold on, you think, hold on, I'm having some new thoughts, and I need more time ...</p>
<p>You know it only takes you four seconds to fall from the Golden Gate? 245 feet, 75 miles per hour. Four-story buildings are only, what, forty feet? I don't know the math, but I don't think that's a lot of time to think or a lot of height to reach a fast speed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Sometimes you don't die instantly when you hit the water off the bridge. You drown or die of hypothermia. Man. I&rsquo;m guessing you&rsquo;re feeling strong when you&rsquo;re flying at the water, going faster than a car on the freeway. You&rsquo;re probably willing yourself to go faster, faster. Probably can&rsquo;t hear a thing except the howl of the wind past your ears and the whipping bolts of energy off the bridge cables . Finally it&rsquo;ll all be over, you&rsquo;re thinking. The black water&rsquo;s getting closer and closer&mdash;1, 2, 3, 4&mdash;<em>Blam</em>. But it&rsquo;s not over. You&rsquo;re in the water now&mdash;coldest water you&rsquo;ve ever been in, if your spine still works&mdash;but you&rsquo;re pretty much egg drop soup at this point. Only thing left intact is your brain, which is the one thing you were trying to shut up. You&rsquo;re deep, deep in the ocean, unable to paddle or see or hear or feel. Just float. Maybe you got a minute. You could make a movie about that one minute. I heard that a lot of people change their minds when they're dying from suicide, like from pills. I figure it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;ve never been in that kind of situation before and it gives them new eyes. Emmylou told me that she heard Henry didn't die right away, that he was lying there gurgling and wheezing like he got the wind knocked out of him, which I guess he probably did. Man, I hope Henry didn't change his mind about wanting to die as he lay there all mangled on the cement. I hope he wanted it, right till the end.</p>
<p>I have a friend named Ben. Second of four brothers, all of whom won the IQ jackpot and went to Ivy League schools. Youngest brother&rsquo;s in high school now, but he's probably going that way, too. Anyway, the third son, Bernard, he was a senior in high school when he died. You could tell by his friends at his memorial that he was cool. Good-looking friends who squared themselves up to the world. I remember his dad saying he had narrowed down his choices to Cal and Brown but was leaning toward Brown. His dad had this one story of how Bernard had come back from his interview with Brown telling him don&rsquo;t worry, he&rsquo;d got it, no problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do you know? His dad asked him as they drove back home.</p>
<p>I got it, he said. 100%.</p>
<p>Ben played a song Bernard had made. It was a hokey song, with synth violins. Knowing Ben, who showed me all this good music, he knew it was hokey, but he still played it. And it was moving now, because the kid was dead.</p>
<p>Ben&rsquo;s the kind of guy you&rsquo;re almost afraid of because of how smart he is. It&rsquo;s humbling to talk to him about something because you know he probably knows more about the thing than you do. I don't know how many times I&rsquo;ve been burned trying to sound smart about something and finding out that he&rsquo;s gone a lot further in that thing than I have. One time I was over at Ben&rsquo;s house and everyone was playing video games in this game room where they had a couch and a bunch of superfast computers. His folks had a really nice big house in one of those gated communities where every house looks the same. They had a pool, too, and I was thinking he&rsquo;d had a good childhood. Man, his engineer dad even taught him calculus when he was about 13. Anyway, I was never good at video games so I was just listening to some music with this really nice pair of headphones he had. They were huge and comfy, and one of the guys asked me if I&rsquo;d found any intelligent life yet. Haha. I was listening to all my favorite songs again because I was hearing things in them I&rsquo;d never heard before, and it was making me happy. I must have fallen asleep at some point, but I remember Ben putting a blanket over me. What I want to say is that he's stupid smart, but he&rsquo;s a real guy, too.</p>
<p>At his brother&rsquo;s memorial the oldest brother whose name is Brian got up and told a story about how this one time Bernard was on the phone with his girlfriend in his room. Brian and Ben were back from college so the whole family was there. Brian had this idea of the three brothers sneaking up on Bernard and scaring the shit out of him. They crawled along his carpet to his bed and they had this signal where they all jumped on him at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know he was capable of screaming like that,&rdquo; Brian said, and everyone laughed. I looked over at his girlfriend. She was biting her lip and looking down. I was thinking about all the brothers messing around like that, and how now whenever they messed around like that they&rsquo;d feel his void, and I damn near cried in my seat, too.</p>
<p>How Bernard died from what I heard was that he was with his friends at an elementary school. They were doing something for the science fair, and they had, I think, propane gas canisters like the ones you use for camping, and also a skateboard. They were trying to propel the skateboards with them or something. I don't know exactly. It was probably a lot smarter than it sounds, you know, like they probably weren't stabbing the canisters with a screwdriver and flicking a lighter at the leak. Anyway, one of them exploded in his face and he bled to death. Man, one minute you're joking around with your friends&mdash;it's the end of senior year, you got a cute smart girlfriend, you got a car, and in a couple months you're going to beautiful Brown where Ben went&mdash;then suddenly there&rsquo;s a bang and a flash and your vision's getting dimmer, there's this warm soup all over your neck, and you&rsquo;re wondering why your friends are looking at you in a way they never have and why you suddenly feel real cold and sleepy, and you think it might be good to close your eyes for a minute.</p>
<p>I was thinking about how his mom was probably at home when she got the call. Maybe she was getting ready for bed, and she'd told Bernard to come home before midnight. She and her husband were glad he'd come out like his older brothers, no smoking, no drinking. Just science fair stuff. Then she gets a call from the hospital. Been an accident, come as soon as possible. Man, she knows. Because they&rsquo;d tell her if he was going to be alright. She's in a dream when they take her downstairs. She knows they only take corpses downstairs. Then there's a gurney with a white sheet over it&mdash;peaked at the nose, the lips, and the big toes&mdash;and she pulls it back.</p>
<p>That elementary school was closed the next day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That spot,&rdquo; the kids would have said when they got back to school, &ldquo;a kid died there. Right there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gas tank exploded in his face. Like a grenade. The shrapnel cut his jugular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother said that if you cut your jugular you automatically bleed to death. Even a paper cut, you'll bleed to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look how the concrete's darker. That's blood, that's his blood.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can't wash blood out. My brother said it's the only thing you can't wash out.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard there wasn't any blood in his body by the time they got him into the ambulance. He was flat, like he got run over or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know he went here, a long time ago? Ms. Corlew remembers him. She said he was really smart, a real genius. All the brothers were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bernard died right there, like the intersection of the concrete squares where Henry landed. I think it would be good to put an engraving on the spots where people have died, just a little symbol or an initial and a 1993-2015 or something. Then when you're walking around all caught up in your thoughts, you might see one and it'd make you think for a bit. But I guess if you did that here, there&rsquo;d be engravings all over. When someone dies in a car or bike accident, they'll paint a bike white and chain it to a pole near where the person got hit or they'll make a mini Catholic shrine. You see them a lot when you're driving bendy mountain roads. There'll be flowers and little trinkets with a photo of the dead person. Usually, it's a Hispanic person, and usually they're young. Young kid like Bernard, why take him? What were all his brains for, all the tennis lessons and the college applications and his great confidence if he was just going to be taken away like that?</p>
<p>My mom told me that when she was little her older sister died in her sleep of carbon monoxide poisoning. A few days earlier my mom had slept over at her sister&rsquo;s house, who was married. She told her sister she should get her pipes looked at because a couple times in the middle of the night she had woken up gasping. Couple days later her sister died in her sleep. I remember my mom told me this while I was walking past her in the living room. I stopped to listen to her and she began to cry. She said it could have been her who died. She asked me if I thought God would have sent her to hell. She said she didn&rsquo;t think so, that it didn&rsquo;t matter who she was or what she had or hadn&rsquo;t done because she was so young. I thought of my mom as a child, youngest of seven, wide-eyed in mortal fear as she stood at the doorway to the bedroom where her sister lay. The whole family huddled in there quiet and crying. I thought of her sister who was eternally young in my mind and who must have looked like my mother when she was young.</p>
<p>My mom&rsquo;s parents owned an undergarments shop and put their kids to work. Someone they knew told her parents that her older brother had a brain and should go to school. He had wanted to go, too. &ldquo;When can I go to school?&rdquo; My mom remembers him asking his dad. But he didn&rsquo;t let him. Instead he had him deliver undergarments by bicycle every morning. One winter he got a bad cough and died.</p>
<p>I walked back home from Unit 2 along Dwight and past People&rsquo;s Park. It&rsquo;s grim walking by that park at night. You think about the myths they gave us about how in the 60s this park was full of all these fresh kids with big glasses and high-waisted pants protesting for free speech or civil rights. Now you&rsquo;ll hardly see a student there, just homeless people with their shopping carts and blue tarps setting up camp for the night. Black garbage bags split open and ragged clothes all over the sidewalk, those cardboard takeout boxes with rotting food all mashed and thrown around. Sometimes needles. People howling, people laughing and talking to themselves. You&rsquo;ll hardly see a girl walking by that park at night, and if you do she&rsquo;ll practically run by it.</p>
<p>Nowadays there aren&rsquo;t too many trees in that park, just stumps. I was guessing they&rsquo;d been cut down pretty recently because there were a lot of cockroaches sniffing and feeling around. That&rsquo;s what happens when you chop down a lot of trees. All the roaches that lived in them were roaming around now. There was one right by my foot. I bent down to get a good look at the guy. Shiny, gummy, amber-brown thing with thorny legs and grooves on its back like a fingerprint. Missing the last half of one of his legs, thing was just hanging off the ground. He was waving his feelers curiously at my foot. Some people really hate the critters, but they don&rsquo;t give me the same reaction that those big jungle centipedes and the potato bugs with their fat juicy yellow legs do. Cockroaches, they&rsquo;re like scarab beetles. They look like very fine machines to me. There&rsquo;s something analytical, thoughtful even, about the way they move their feelers, and the way they&rsquo;ll respond to your vibrations. Even their heads look like they&rsquo;ve been clicked into place, and that they&rsquo;d spark and be a mess of chips and wires if you stepped on one of them. I did my best to avoid that, though, all the way down Dwight till I got back onto Telegraph. Aashik and Axel&rsquo;s apartment was right where Berkeley turns into Oakland, where Telegraph starts to die.</p>
<p>All the way back I was thinking about my mom&rsquo;s dead brother going to school for the first time. I bet he&rsquo;d have a couple new pencils and some new clothes, or maybe just some hand-me-downs that his mom washed and ironed for him the night before. Thought about his eight brothers and sisters buzzing around him as he eats a sturdy breakfast that morning, teasing him. But inside, they&rsquo;re proud. My mom not really understanding what&rsquo;s going on but zipping around on the mood of it all. His dad and his older brothers trying to give him advice. Thought about him sitting up straight at his desk before school starts while all the other kids are running around. There&rsquo;s a freshly sharpened pencil lined up on it, and he loves that thing&mdash;how sharp the tip is, how pristine the pink eraser&mdash;and he promises himself he&rsquo;s going to work as hard as he can because it sure beats riding his bike every morning.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>CHAPTER 13</p>
<p>WE WENT OUT to San Francisco that night with Aashik&rsquo;s friends, Polk Street. I always have these expectations for bars, and then you go to them and no one even talks to anyone outside their group, at least in the cities. Then even within your group all people want to talk about is some meal they had, like they&rsquo;ve just had a religious experience with the damn Pieta. Like one of Aashik&rsquo;s friends was telling me that he was tired of giving his soul to this company that was about to roll out self-driving cars. He was a sincere Indian guy, small and skinny with a nice smile and brown, curly hair. One of those guys who looked like he could be anywhere from 18 or 28. Anyway, he tells me he wants out. That got me excited, you know, I was going, Yes man, get the hell outta here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; I asked him. &ldquo;You probably got enough savings to do whatever the hell you want. You gonna have a great adventure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man, I want to eat good food,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want to travel the world and eat good food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. Have you ever been to Singapore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <em>have</em> to go to Singapore and try the satay there. Literally heaven in my mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This damn fool, I thought. You&rsquo;d think that food was the greatest good we ever got. You think a Michelin-Star satay would have stopped Henry from jumping? Dangle that shit out the window and tell him to come off the ledge?&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a girl with us who was one of Aashik&rsquo;s friends from one of his business classes. She was interested in me from the beginning of the night, and I figured I could use it. We went from bar to bar, and when I went outside for some air she followed me out and was familiar with me like we&rsquo;d been going out for a while. She had a big chest and she kept brushing up against me. She was like a little girl with her high voice. She&rsquo;d just finished an internship at Nielsen, where they do all the TV ratings, and she&rsquo;d just gotten something full time at Unilever, that company whose fuzzy &ldquo;U&rdquo; you see on everything, from shampoo bottles to peanut butter jars. Data analysis, she said. Wow, I said. She told me all of this in that very generous voice that successful people have when they&rsquo;re talking about their careers. She asked me what I was up to. Not much, I said. But then I told her a little about my travels and the scars on my thighs, and there was a lurch. I want to see them, she said, and brought her chest to me again.</p>
<p>Then after some drinks we went over the bridge back to her apartment. Our driver was an older guy who drove sometimes on the weekends for some extra money. He had a little trouble with how to get onto the Bay Bridge and how to get off, and the girl was very sure with the directions. You&rsquo;re a superstar, he told her. He knew what was going on and kept hinting that he was really happy for me, and I tried to buy into it too but couldn&rsquo;t because we were about to go use each other. After some wine in foam cups we went to her bed and when I finished the air was metallic and after I washed I left her apartment and walked out down a hill back home. Felt like I needed to have a real human moment so I hit up a girl named Natalie who I knew was having a birthday party at her pre-med frat. I went over and headed right for the liquor. I was already messed up but you can always use some more when you&rsquo;re at a new place. There were still a lot of people at the party, but it was that part of the night where drinking more just makes you dead in the eyes. I go sit across from these two girls on a couch. We were talking a little. The older one was an alumna, she was at real med school now, Harvard. Damn, <em>Har</em>vard, I kept saying, and they laughed at that. The younger one was a freshman, cute delicate girl. She wasn&rsquo;t drinking, and she was being shy. I poured shots and pushed them toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s had enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing he&rsquo;s talking about the freshman, because the older girl just looks amused. The freshman girl whose name is Sara looks like she wants to disappear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look man,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you let your friend decide for herself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guy doesn&rsquo;t say anything, just stands right in front of me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just trying to have a drink with your friends, man. I&rsquo;m not trying to rape them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By now, there are a couple of his friends leering over at us. Man, when I said that, I might as well have said that I <em>was</em> trying to rape them. They got all excited, all primal, like I was the goddamn devil, man, and I was wondering if they could <em>smell</em> it on me. Then one of them, big guy, came up to me and asked me who I knew here.</p>
<p>I just wanted to show them I wasn&rsquo;t a bad guy, and so I turned to Elliott and asked him if he wanted to go outside to talk it out. I just wanted to make a goddamn real connection, man, just have a real goddamn human moment. But everyone there took it to mean that I wanted to fight the guy, and finally Natalie told me it&rsquo;d be best if I left. She talked to me outside for a minute, telling me that Elliott and Sara went way back to when they were kids, had grown up together and all that. Well, how the hell was I supposed to know that I was playing an extra in their goddamn Korean drama? But I was so messed up that I just told her <em>okay, okay I get it</em>. I decided to run back home, as fast as I could, falling over a couple times. Couple miles later I entered the apartment. I couldn&rsquo;t breathe, felt like someone was squeezing my brain. My heart was going real fast, man, thought I was having a heart attack, and I was spiralling bad, trying to bottom out by telling myself things that I was sure about, trying to find some footing. But I was a freak, man, I knew it, and so did everyone else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh man,&rdquo; I whispered as I walked around the apartment. &ldquo;Oh man, oh man, oh man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll take a bath, I thought. A hot bath will help me.</p>
<p>Took off my clothes and ran the hot water. Put my mouth underwater and screamed. I was panicking real bad, man. Everything was coming up now. Man, I wanted to kill my dad for doing what he did to me. I wanted to kill him, and I wanted to kill my brother, too. I put my mouth to the faucet and coughed as it came into my lungs. I thrust my head underwater. My forehead hit the tub floor. The water fell over my head and rumbled around me. I put my hands over my ears and started pulling at my hair. Nothing was ever going to change for me. Again and again, I thought. Day after day, night after night, year after year.</p>
<p>The door boomed behind me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; I shouted.</p>
<p>It was Aashik. He said something I couldn&rsquo;t hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; I shouted again. The door was locked. I reached over and unlocked it, slapping it out with a wet hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; He asked me.</p>
<p>I slapped the water. &ldquo;Taking a bath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you feeling? You ran home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. I fell, too. Fucked my knee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you feeling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not too good. I'm going to throw up.&rdquo; I crawled to the toilet and began retching. &ldquo;I'm sorry,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m sorry, man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aashik, I&rsquo;m a piece of shit. I&rsquo;m a piece of shit, man. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a piece of shit, man. I&rsquo;m delusional. I have nothing, man, nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put a towel over my back and his hand on my head and from above I heard him cry quietly, too.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>CHAPTER 14</p>
<p>THE DAY AFTER that night with Aashik, I was on the John Muir Trail. I figured it was time to head back to LA to my parents, and I thought I&rsquo;d do a long hike to get there. I took a train to Merced and hopped on a bus to get to Yosemite Valley.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a lot of extra stuff with me because I was moving, like my laptop and clothes and books, so I was packing close to 50 lbs. Man, I really overestimated my strength there. First day was a half day, so it was alright. It was the beginning of a long climb, something like a mile-gain over 15 miles. There were a lot of day hikers on the trail, too. Up, up, up. Second day was where it hurt. I&rsquo;d banged my knee pretty good when I fell running back to the apartment, so I made a wooden staff and used it like a crutch whenever I went downhill. Man, crawling up, up, up while you&rsquo;re surrounded by trees. Not so many people around to talk to, either. I thought I was hearing voices in the scratch of squirrel claws gripping tree bark or the gurgling streams, whispers in the brush. Thought I was seeing tents where there were boulders and hikers where there were saplings. Eyes in the dark knots of aspens. I had to stop every ten minutes to rest, too. I didn&rsquo;t know how to properly adjust my pack so it was hanging off me and killing my shoulders. It was so heavy for me that I had to prop it up and sit down to get the straps on. My head was becoming a bad place. I got to a point where I was so tired that I got my sleeping bag out and went inside it for a few minutes just a couple feet off the trail. But I was thinking I&rsquo;d be embarrassed if someone saw me like that, so I took a couple bites from a bar and kept going. Five minutes later, Tuolumne Meadows opened up to me.</p>
<p>Between the grandfatherly granite domes on either side, brown brooks cut through a plain of tall lush grass carrying water so clear that you only knew it was there because the sun glittered on it, and so appetizing that when you leaned over to cup it to your lips, you felt stronger. There was a great feeling of vitality in the meadow, as if the sun shone more brightly upon it, as if the rich black soil was denser with nutrients, the water with more minerals. It was in the sweet cold air, the kind that you breathe in after a snowfall, in the green pines that were strong and healthy, and in the glossy, athletic deer that grazed and sprung lightly from each other. It was in all the colors, too. The sky was bluer and deeper, the clouds richer, the wildflowers with their plump, velvet petals concentrating blues, whites, oranges, and purples in a way I only thought the birds and fishes of the tropics could. I walked through that meadow in a daze that something like this was real, and that I was in it. Then I thought about what Aashik had done for me, and tears came down my face. I promised myself that someday I would repay him. As I made my way south through the Sierras over the next two weeks this feeling visited me every day, and I&rsquo;d have to sit on a fallen tree or a boulder and wait for it to pass.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>CHAPTER 15</p>
<p>SUMMER OF NASHVILLE, &lsquo;17, you gave me your copy of Rilke&rsquo;s <em>Letters to a Young Poet</em> and said that no one writes letters like this anymore. A few weeks before that, in our dorm at Lutsen, I shared with you an idea I had for a series of little books: Through the course of my life I&rsquo;d try to convince you of the existence of God. You got up from your bed and came over to mine, which made me sit up fast. There was a fire in your eyes as you paced our shabby room, something I hadn&rsquo;t seen in you for a long time. You said that it was a good idea, but that I would have to give you very convincing arguments. I got a lot of strength from you.</p>
<p>Well, this is the best I got. I&rsquo;m no Rilke, and I got no arguments of reason. You&rsquo;ve heard them all, and I don&rsquo;t want to debate you on that because you would probably win. Nor do I want to rattle off a list of points for the proof of the resurrection. All I&rsquo;ve got for you are some stories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been five years since that night with Aashik, and I still don&rsquo;t know exactly what happened, only that I keep coming back to it. I&rsquo;ve tried to explain it to you and to other people many times, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever found the right words. The truth is that some part of me died that night. It hurt a lot. But as the part fell away I felt as light as I used to when I was a boy. And the next morning when I woke up on the couch with only that towel around me and the sun coming strong through the windows, the lightness was still there. Couple hours later I was on the train to Yosemite.</p>
<p>Here are two more stories for you. It&rsquo;s okay if you still think I&rsquo;m full of shit. I figure I got about 50 years to get it right, and it&rsquo;s not looking like I&rsquo;ll be getting a 9 to 5 anytime soon.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>CHAPTER 16</p>
<p>COUPLE MONTHS AGO I was at my brother&rsquo;s wedding. It was a very fine wedding. My brother rented out an entire restaurant at Bryant Park. We took our photos in front of the steps of the New York Public Library, at dinner there was steak, the waitstaff was offering plates of hors d'oeuvres, and my wine glass was fat the whole night. It was a rare experience for someone like me who doesn&rsquo;t make much money and lives with his parents.</p>
<p>I was one of the groomsmen and the ring-bearer. It had been humid the day before, but today it was cool, and the evening was coming. There were about a hundred guests seated on the terrace overlooking a large lawn of grass on which hundreds of New Yorkers were picnicking. Before them lay a stage above which a banner read: OTHELLO 7PM. I was wearing a tuxedo that my brother had sent to me a week prior to secure its fit. My brother and his bride read their vows, something about loading the dishwasher and closing the kitchen cabinets, and while the other groomsmen beamed and chuckled towards them, I looked away.</p>
<p>The last meaningful encounter I had with him before the wedding happened about a year ago when he came home for a week. I&rsquo;d just gotten back to California after hitchhiking from Nashville. He came into my room one day just before I was going out for a run and asked me where his hiking pack was. I told him that I had sold it to my friend. That was you. He hadn&rsquo;t used it in years, and I thought he wouldn&rsquo;t notice it was gone or that he wouldn&rsquo;t care because he made a lot of money. He was angry with me. I asked him how much it cost. He told me I owed him $150, so I gave it to him in cash. He kept telling me not to touch his stuff. I told him that since I had just paid him, that was the end. He wouldn&rsquo;t stop, though, said he was only angry because I had sold it. It&rsquo;s the principle, he said. Man, I was thinking about how I was working from sunup to midnight putting up Christmas lights for $15 bucks an hour now, and I didn&rsquo;t want to hear him talk about principle. I felt at that moment the urge to be violent toward him. You greedy fucking bastard, I said and left. I started running up near these hills, thinking about how my parents had to choose, him or me, because I didn&rsquo;t want anything to do with him anymore. When I got to the top and the whole city was in view I got to my knees and started to cry.</p>
<p>Couple weeks ago you told me that when you saw your mother for the first time in two years, she cried. I bet you saw her in a different way. Man, it&rsquo;s a shame that for all we think we&rsquo;ve learned, we still don&rsquo;t know how to be brothers and sons.</p>
<p>My brother and mother had their dance before the wedding dinner. They danced to the song &ldquo;Moon River&rdquo; by Audrey Hepburn. My mother approached my brother with that hurt expression of someone who&rsquo;s trying hard not to cry, and my brother&rsquo;s were big with the fear that she might fall apart in his arms. It was when I saw the light on her sharp cheekbone that an image from a dream I had appeared in my mind: it&rsquo;s my mother on a bed. Her eyes are sunken in, her hair is white and floats in the morning light, and her bones poke from her skin and gown. She&rsquo;s halfway into another world now, more spirit than body, and I figured it wouldn&rsquo;t be long before our parents were gone.</p>
<p>After dinner I met eyes with someone I had spotted earlier, a man my brother has known since high school. I remembered that he&rsquo;d been a handsome man who&rsquo;d been in cross country with my brother, and that he&rsquo;d gotten into a bad car accident one night that almost killed him. He was there with his girlfriend. His name was Jason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember you,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;I remember thinking when I saw you: that&rsquo;s a good-looking man.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>He laughed, and we talked for a few minutes. Then, almost abruptly, he said: &ldquo;Do you know what your brother said about you a few days ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said that he was really hard on you when you were little. But he said that you were the smartest person he knew, and the best soccer player. &rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly after this, I was standing at the bar when another man approached me. He was my brother&rsquo;s friend from college. They had been in the same fraternity. He was a shorter man with a closely shaved head, and he looked at me craftily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;James&rsquo; brother,&rdquo; he said to me. We shook hands. He asked me what I was drinking. I told him I was going for a whiskey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do a tequila shot,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>So we did, with the lime and the salt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was going on with you up there?&rdquo; He asked me.</p>
<p>I asked him what he meant. He said that I looked like I didn&rsquo;t want to be there. &ldquo;Who is that guy?&rdquo; He had asked his friend during the ceremony. That&rsquo;s his brother, his friend told him.</p>
<p>I was very ashamed of what I&rsquo;d done. I&rsquo;d promised myself that I wouldn&rsquo;t say a word out of line for the few days that I was in New York. It&rsquo;s my brother&rsquo;s wedding, I thought, and he&rsquo;s chosen me as one of his groomsmen and the ring-bearer. So I was thinking I&rsquo;d try to be gracious. But as I stood at the altar, I saw inside me that I still hated him. I told the man that I was ashamed of myself. He told me that I should go talk to my brother.</p>
<p>The night continued from the bar to a club across the street, and I found myself patting the back of a groomsmen who was heaving into a silver dish that was shaped like a dog&rsquo;s bowl. My sister had been coaxed into having too many drinks by the other groomsmen, and her boyfriend was trying to keep her upright on the dance floor. My brother came over to me, and I rose to greet him. He told me that he was sorry for how he had treated me in the past, and he said it hurt him when I didn&rsquo;t ask him for his help in Central America. He embraced me. Tears came freely down my face, and I put my arms around him. I saw him then as my strong brother, who was a husband now and a father soon, and I wished we could be real brothers.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>CHAPTER 17</p>
<p>THIS IS THE LAST STORY, the one where it all comes together. Go back to Nashville, Fat-Bottom Ale, and that front porch. Go inside and hear Mike crooning in his room like he&rsquo;s in a boy band and Mamadou dicking down your ear about Elon Musk and the singularity. Dustin and Manny squatting in the basement, and you almost killing their dog. Back at Taqueria you had side salads, sweet tea, silverware, chef&rsquo;s specials, and Laticia asking you to fertilize her. That imp Israel with his gold tooth and Javier with his thousand-yard stare. It was a world, just like working up at Lutsen was. Man, I bet you think about that food sometimes, how good it was. Smoked pulled pork with slaw, brisket, enchiladas with lemon-cream sauce.</p>
<p>The second Taqueria had just opened on Charlotte, a couple miles from the first. You and I were about to work there. One night we had a soft opening for family and friends, and I was working a double. Our manager JC was waddling around with his big ass and being neurotic because Tony was there. I was trying to work at my usual pace, but he kept ordering me around. I hadn&rsquo;t eaten anything that day and the layout of the restaurant was different&mdash;all the napkins, plates, silverware, and towels were in different places, and learning all of it again was frustrating. I slowed down toward the end of the night as customers began to leave. JC told me to keep moving. I told him to calm down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t you tell me to calm down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calm down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked away.</p>
<p>Tony came over later and apologized to me. He told me I had to think about his &ldquo;main motive,&rdquo; that he wanted a happy restaurant, a happy family here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not your main motive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, what&rsquo;s my main motive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your main motive is to make money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When my shift ended I rode my bike back to work. Cars rushed by in both directions. I went out in the middle of the road. A car stopped for me. I pedaled quickly past it and then a car hit me. I saw the night sky swivel before me as I was thrown back, and I had one very quiet thought, that that was that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hit the ground on my hip and my elbow and wrist. As soon as I realized that I wasn&rsquo;t dead, something took over me. I got up from the ground. Cars swerved past on either side of me. I wanted to shout with how strong I felt. When I told you this story you said it was adrenaline. But I&rsquo;ve felt adrenaline before. This took over my whole being with a strength and a love, and it told me what I had to do. I had to make things right with my parents, my brother, my sister, and you.</p>
<p>A few weeks earlier I had gone off you. We were at a bar with Julio. Every Wednesday they had a buy one, get one special. My drink was five dollars so I tipped one. You sniggered, and I got angry. I thought about how you still owed me 800 bucks and how I had bought the motorcycle that we now shared and about how I had cooked for you at Lutsen and done things for you that you never noticed and how many times I wished I was travelling alone. All the way back to the car I shouted at you about how you were a shitty friend. You kept saying I was right and to stop. You said it was hard being around me, too. But I couldn&rsquo;t stop and I kept shouting at you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Couple days later when we were walking back home with a six-pack of good beer you turned to me and said I had been a good friend to you. You said you didn&rsquo;t think you had been a good one. I was very ashamed when you said that, and I thought about when I was at Bonnaroo with Carley. You sent me a text that you were going through a couple six-packs every day and that you were in a really dark place right now. I remember looking at my phone and putting it away. Man, I&rsquo;ll never do that again.</p>
<p>When we first got into Nashville we were at that hostel on D.B. Todd for a few weeks. I had gotten a message from the hostel owner that we had to move out because we were messy. You and I were working when I got the message. I showed it to you, right inside the double doors to the kitchen, and we looked at each other. Then we started laughing. Later you apologized to the owner and said that you were going through a hard time. You said that I should get to stay because you had been the messy one. You told me you would find your own housing. But we moved out together anyway and found that house with the big porch. We&rsquo;d get some good beer and talk for hours about everything on that porch. I never enjoyed a beer more with anyone than with you. We would ride on the bike together to go to work or to go grocery shopping. You drove because you&rsquo;re bigger than me. Maybe you&rsquo;re a better driver, too. On a nice stretch of road I would lean back on the seat rest and feel the way I used to when I was little and hung out with my brother. I remembered how when this all started it was supposed to be you and me, Kerouac and Cassady, running and stumbling through the deserts and mountains and plains of America.</p>
<p>I got up from the street. There were cars and their headlights rushing past me. I took my mangled bike to the sidewalk and limped over to the woman who had come out of the car that hit me. She was crying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay. It was my fault.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, God bless you,&rdquo; she cried, and I hugged her.</p>
<p>A guy who&rsquo;d seen the crash asked me if I wanted a ride home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I saw you die, man,&rdquo; he said, and he reached over and touched my shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too, man,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>I was going to get home and hug you and tell you that you were a brother to me. You were on that front porch smoking and listening to music. The sun was making scales out of the roof tiles and diamonds out of the asphalt. The great Southern critter orgy was all around and all night long. You saw me coming up that long driveway, and you were grinning when you asked me how work was. But when you saw me limping and the look in my eyes, yours got big and you made me sit down in your chair. You lit me a cigarette because my hands were trembling. So I never got to tell you that.</p>
<p>Well, now you&rsquo;re in Bangkok teaching English. Sometimes I can&rsquo;t believe how long you&rsquo;ve been in that jungle, but it&rsquo;s coming on two years now. I think about you a lot over there in Siam getting in your taxi with your boys, going from Khao San&mdash;with the African prostitutes and guttural ladyboys and the balloons and the gooey black scorpions on skewers&mdash;to Soi Cowboy and that place by your apartment with the pink light.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking at some dirt-cheap land in the Olympic National Forest. Cheap because even though it&rsquo;s on a nice lake, you need a boat to get there. It&rsquo;s surrounded on its other three sides by mountains and rainforest, and there are no roads to get there. So I&rsquo;m thinking of spending some time there to get myself right, and if you want you can come visit. I think it&rsquo;ll be good for you and me to go back to where you got to work for everything, your water, your shelter, your food. We&rsquo;ll have the whole forest to bang around in. I&rsquo;ve only seen videos and photos of Olympia and the Hoh Rainforest, but it looks wet, lush, and ancient, like Dionysius&rsquo;ll be there all covered in moss dancing in a ring with all his crazy-ass maenads. We can learn about the stuff we&rsquo;ve been putting off, we can build shit, hunt deer and elk, fish for rainbow trout and sockeye salmon, and follow the Quinault into Enchanted Valley. Maybe I&rsquo;ll have a little cabin set up before you arrive. And maybe there&rsquo;ll be a little porch for it, too, or maybe just a couple stumps in front of a big fire, and we can talk. It&rsquo;s my opinion that you and me have our life&rsquo;s work cut out for us, and we should get to it once we&rsquo;ve made ourselves more useful.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I think about Henry Treadway and Bernard Moon. He&rsquo;d be about to graduate from Brown now. I think about my mom&rsquo;s sister waking up dead and her brother wanting to go to school, John, Richard, the little girl wondering how you can kill yourself, my mom her knees asking God to help her with her husband, and my dad as a kid looking up at the moon and wondering if his mother was ever coming back. I think about Alex as a kid punching her wall by her bed and wishing things were different and wanting her to know that I&rsquo;m there for her if she wants. My mom crying on my brother&rsquo;s chest to &ldquo;Moon River.&rdquo; I think about you sitting by yourself in Cafe Coco. You told your mom that it would be better to die than to live with all your worries. Then at the table you wept. I think also about when we went to the thrift store to find boots for you in wintery Minneapolis. There weren&rsquo;t a lot of options because your feet are so damn big, but we looked and looked and I found you a pair. You laced them up and said, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re my friend, man.</p>
