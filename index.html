<center><h1>STORIES FOR A FRIEND</h1></center>
<br>
<br>
<p> </p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>I FIGURED the best way to tell you this story is to tell it like we're back on that porch in Nashville. Come back late from closing at Taqueria, your brain fried and your back stiff. Toss your tips into the money pile in your closet and come out for a beer and a smoke. The sun&rsquo;s gold-red flare&rsquo;s on the roof tiles and the waxy leaves, and the crunchy black street vibrates hot from the day. The air&rsquo;s thick with water, strips the brown bottles of their wrappers and drips over our knuckles. There&rsquo;s the great critter orgy all around us. The sirens and clicks and belches like an orchestra having one collective stroke. Mazzy Star from your phone. The puffs sharpen the pulls, the smoke shoos the mosquitoes, and the talking&rsquo;s easy and filling, like a hot meal.</p>
<p>Couple reasons I dropped out of school and hitchhiked to Panama, one of them being that I spent my whole life being corralled into shit I didn't want to do. I pretty much did the same stuff that my brother did in high school, and I even went to the same college. Day of orientation, he wrote me a list of business classes I should take. You should just major in business if you don't know what you want to do, he said. I don't mean any disrespect to Cal because there's a lot to learn in a school like that. I know you got a lot out of your philosophy classes. But my experience was with kids whose biggest interest in art was how to dress the part and professors who were talking about literary patricide and The Death of the Author. Felt like there was a lot of performance going on. But I know I wasn&rsquo;t ready to learn&mdash;if I could go back I'd try to get the most out it. I'd probably study philosophy like you or math like Axel did, if I&rsquo;m up for it. Second reason I left was because I had just broken up with a girl named Alex. She was the realest thing that happened to me and without her just about everything in my life dried up. Last reason, this sounds dumb, but the way things were going I knew I could have gone my whole life without knowing my real character, if I was strong or weak, brave or cowardly. You know how in some of the books we read when we were little there's the boy in the tribe or the village. He's not the strongest or the biggest kid, but he's got a brain and he's good. When he gets a little older he leaves his home for a journey. His dad's solemn about it, but he's proud because it's something he's got to do. His mom's sad, maybe his little sister, too. But he goes and runs into people who need his help, and it's scrappy, but he helps them. Months and years pass, and he becomes strong, a leader. Then he comes home and no one recognizes him because he's a man now, with the glint and everything. I wanted that, I wanted to be a man, and I wanted people to think I was one, too.</p>
<p>But the truth is that I didn't do a whole lot those six months. Most of it I spent walking on the road, standing there with my thumb out, getting mad and sad when people would just stare at me or give me the thumbs-up back. I had no money so I slept outside a lot, and I stole to eat. Gas stations, grocery stores. I worked at a ranch, a hostel, on a boat, on an island, but I wasn't a good worker, and usually I took more than I deserved. I never been so low in my life. And the loneliness, man. I missed everyone so much. Thinking about my friends, thinking about Alex, making up conversations and fantasies about seeing them again or re-doing things that I'd messed up. Towards the end I was getting pretty loopy&mdash;I was in my own movie, interviewing myself, talking about the scenery, and laughing at my own jokes. Maybe you don&rsquo;t know this, but you were about the only friend I had during that time, the only person I really talked to. You wrote me that you always looked forward to reading the writing I put up. I remember reading that while I was down and out and feeling like I had at least one good reason.</p>
<p>Like I said, I was expecting to come back with some education, but the whole time I was thinking: Man, what the hell have I learned so far? So when I got back to Berkeley to go live with my friends, I was more lost than ever. I remember this one night my friends and I were going to meet at Albatross. The man at the entrance asked for my ID, but I'd forgotten my wallet so I left and started walking back home. It was a five-mile walk and I hadn't brought my headphones so I tried to make myself sturdy for the loneliness of it. It was raining a little. I put my hood on and my hands in my pockets and tried to think about something nice. The leaves were brown and fallen and the ones that weren't stuck to the sidewalk like wet brown paper skittered on it like a child was pulling them along on a string. Only the homeless were out. Man, you know how it is here. They wear the clear ponchos flecked with rain and have blue tarps tied with bungee cord over shopping carts that look like they&rsquo;re carrying a garage sale. They're everywhere, and at night you see them sleeping everywhere, too. Some in the recessed entrances of shopfronts. On the sidewalk, on the grass in People's Park, over the steam vents on campus. They sleep in worn sleeping bags on cardboard. Most of them pull their bags over their faces, and all you see is a covered mound.</p>
<p>One of them didn't cover her face, and I recognized her as the woman I'd seen on my way to the bar. She was an Asian woman, Japanese was my guess. They've been here longer so they got more time than the other Asians to fall off. She was about 45. I always saw her sitting on the sidewalk of Telegraph near where people are always selling jewelry and spiritual stuff. She always wore a black beanie over her greasy bangs. Her face was always tanned unevenly like someone who's been skiing with goggles, and her eyes were always big like she was dazed. Couldn&rsquo;t tell if it was because she was nice or on something.</p>
<p>I was walking by her on my way to the bar while she was getting ready for bed. This was somewhere on San Pablo, and I was pretty sure I hadn't passed Albatross yet, so I asked her to make sure.</p>
<p>"Albatross?" I pointed down the street.</p>
<p>She nodded and pointed the same way. "But you gotta buy me dinner first." Then she cackled, and that made me laugh.</p>
<p>She was asleep now. She had the sunken and puckered mouth of someone without teeth and that frown that kids have when they&rsquo;re asleep after a long day of running around, like they&rsquo;re really deep in a good dream. Man, how'd she get to be like that? Her parents were probably interned during the war. Maybe she was Hawaiian-Japanese. They wanted her to be a good student, and she probably was. How'd she fall off like that, though? Now she was that sister or that aunt that no one talks to, no one knows where she is.</p>
<p>My dad's got a friend who owns a gardening supply store. Had it for years. He and his wife worked there all the time and made a lot of money. They&rsquo;ve got a couple nice cars and a nice house. They got a son, though, who's homeless. They kicked him out because he'd steal all their shit and sell it to buy heroin. The mom started noticing a lot of her stuff going missing, like her clothes, jewelry, even a goddamn leather armchair. So now he was just hanging out with other homeless people. My dad said he saw him by an on-ramp one day. Just lying there all burnt in the sun. The parents, they said they'd done all they could for him, and that what he did was his own business now. Man, how can you say that? How can you leave your son like that? So that's it then? You did all you could, end of story? I don't know. I guess it's hard enough trying to get your own life right to worry about someone else's. And I guess it&rsquo;s true that there&rsquo;s a point where you just can&rsquo;t reach a person anymore. I've never gone out of my way to really help anyone either. Just a couple days ago Alex had contacted me, wondering if I was back now. We caught up for a bit, and I asked her how she was doing now. She told me about she was having a little trouble in Seattle, how she wasn't doing so well in school right now, but what got me was that she said she wasn&rsquo;t okay. She'd never said that to me before. I always knew there was something going on with her, ever since she was a kid. Once she told me about how her parents and her sister fought a lot, and how sometimes she would punch her bedroom wall. She was never sad or down when we were together, but I always had the feeling that I never got to the bottom of her. But now she was telling me something important, and I just said something like "Sorry to hear that." She said she'd be alright, and we talked about something else. I remember when we were eighteen and she was leaving for college all the way in Boston. We talked on the phone and when it was time to go, I said: "See you when I see you?" And she said, "I love you, too." And I said "I love you, too." She said she'd never said that to anyone. &ldquo;So what do we do now?&rdquo; I asked her. She said maybe it meant that we should always be there for each other. &ldquo;Deal,&rdquo; I said. I didn't think too seriously about that at the time. But when she told me she wasn't okay&mdash;okay, the truth is that it's not that important because that was a long time ago and she's probably forgotten all about it&mdash;but I should have kept my end of the bargain.</p>
<p>All of a sudden I wanted to go back to that Japanese lady and wake her up and ask her what happened to her. But I didn't and never would. That's the thing with the homeless here. They love to talk. I figure it's because they got no one who'll listen to them. One night I was walking on the greenway that goes north-south along the BART line, and I saw a woman having trouble setting up an orange tent on the grass. Those dome tents are tricky by yourself, so I helped her set it up. She didn't look dirty or anything, she could have been my friend&rsquo;s mom. She looked about fifty, and she had this nice, thick mane of silver-gray hair. Anyway, she was really grateful and said I was really nice. She said she was an artist and pointed to her black bag, the big square ones that hold canvasses. I asked her what kind of painting she did, and she went on and on about being down and out, how she was saving for a studio right now, how her boyfriend had kicked her out, how his cat had scratched her eye, and how she'd had a bad reaction. She peeled back her eyelid and showed me her eyeball, and I leaned over and said "Oh, yeah." Man, she wouldn't stop. I told her I had to go and gave her a couple bucks, and she told me to come visit her. That made me sad when she said that.</p>
<p>There's a couple characters you see all the time around Berkeley. Like the guy Aashik and I always got a kick out of. He's an old Indian guy with an afro that's turning white at the roots. He's always wearing a dirty tan tunic and matching pants. The first couple times we saw him, up by Sproul Gate, we thought he was holding his hand out to me and saying "Asian, Asian." But later I realized he was saying "Any change, any change," which makes more sense.</p>
<p>There's an old white guy who looks he should be on a Roman coin. Got the white beard and the nose for it. I always see him lounging on some bench on campus, looking like he's eating grapes from the vine at a feast. He's always moving around campus with his big body bag, the kind that military guys have, only his is blue. In my head I called him Diogenes. One time I saw him reading him a paperback by those benches outside Dwinelle. I was so curious about what he was reading that I circled back around him. I got down on one knee to pretend to tie my shoe and got a look at the cover. It was one of those harlequin romances, with a Tarzan-looking fellow on the cover. With one hand he's holding a girl wearing a nightgown, and like a ship's mast with the other. And the way I was looking up at him, you couldn't have seen it otherwise, but one of his hands was down his sweatpants. After that he became Caligula.</p>
<p>Caligula, he likes to sleep on this one steam vent on Bancroft, by the tennis courts. I bet you've walked by that vent at night and heard the rats down there going <em>scree, scree, scree</em> like they're fighting a rat war down there. I tried looking into that vent one night to try get a look at this rat colony. There was warm sticky steam coming out of it so it was hard to get a good look, but the steam took a break sometimes. I got my phone light out and put it to the grate. There were big, kitten-sized rats scrambling over one another taking chunks out of a burger that looked like it&rsquo;d been put through a meat grinder. Ketchup, mayonnaise, BLT&mdash;the rats were all over it. There was sauce all over the grate so I&rsquo;m thinking either someone stuffed it down there or the rats dragged it in. Rats, you know, they don't have bad faces. They're big mice. But their tails is what get me. Thick wormy things, like surgery scars or insect feelers. It was almost evil. You got to have something going on in your head if you can fall asleep over that.</p>
<p>When I was still in school I once went to this Friday church service that my brother told me to go to. This sophomore named Nathan brought Caligula there, and he just looked confused the whole time. I remember after it was over and I was on my way out, I saw Nathan asking Caligula if he could pray for him. His eyes kind of bulged and he nodded. Nathan thanked God for their meeting and prayed for his health and stuff. I sent a silent prayer over, too, that he could knock his habit of jacking off on campus.</p>
<p>I got to know Nathan. He was nice to me, and I thought he was alright. He was really upbeat, the kind of guy you don't want to be around for too long because you don't want to be sullen around him and have him ask you if you want to talk. Kind of guy who&rsquo;d just look at you with a frozen smile if you made a messed up joke around him. Everything's God's will, according to him. If God wills it, he says, like he's a Crusader. He was a short guy with the black plastic glasses and a big smile, big front teeth I remember, and if you weren't too smart then you might think there was something saintly about him. I had told him about my travels and how I wanted to be a writer, and he went around introducing me to the other churchgoers as Tom Sawyer. This one night he hit me up and asked me if I was free. We met by the Subway on Bancroft and Telegraph, right before Sproul, and the first thing he does when he sees me is he quotes a line from a story I shared with him. I remember the line, and it was a bad, self-important line. Hearing it from his mouth made me realize that. So we start walking through Sproul past the bulletin that's ten deep with fliers and past those trees that line the plaza. You know what trees I'm talking about? They're not too tall and in the fall they lose their leaves and their stubby branches look like knuckles. Knuckle trees, I think whenever I see them. Anyway, Nathan tells me that he and his girlfriend are going to write a book.</p>
<p>"About what?"</p>
<p>"About God.</p>
<p>"What about him?"</p>
<p>"About his goodness. About his grace, and his majesty."</p>
<p>Then he says the reason he wants to talk to me is because he and his girlfriend want my blessing to write their damn book.</p>
<p>Nathan went to my brother's church in San Francisco, like the whole Cal church group did. That was a long drive, all the way to Daly City. I remember this one sermon by this guy named Pastor Ryan. Big brutish guy, liked to wear cardigans. He had this one sermon about selflessness and all I remember about it is him talking about how these pop stars rented out a whole hospital for the birth of their baby, and that made them selfish. And about how he bought an iPad for his son who didn't like to share it, and that was also selfish but not as selfish as renting out a whole hospital and kicking out everyone on life support. He liked to say things with real emphasis, even though what he was saying wasn't the kind of thing that needed it. At the end of the sermon he told us that when you get God, he'll move your bowels. That made me laugh, and a couple people turned around and looked at me. At lunch I sat down by my brother and tried to talk to him about what he got out of it all. This and that, he said. I knew he'd been sleeping for most of it. Head back with his mouth open. My brother does this thing where if he doesn't want to talk he'll just ignore you. You ask him something important and he'll get this dark look on his face and pretend he didn't hear you.</p>
<p>Reason I was going to church in the first place was that after I got back from Panama, I spent a month at my brother's. &ldquo;Of course, man,&rdquo; he replied when I messaged him to see if I could stay at his place. Man, bad day. When I arrived he asked me if he could use my suitcase for when he went to New York to see his girlfriend. His was too small. I emptied the suitcase of my things. He took his things out of his suitcase and put them in mine. This suitcase was also his. He had left it at home four years ago, and I had used it since. I looked around his small studio apartment. There was barely any room. I didn&rsquo;t want him to make room for me. I&rsquo;d be okay just sleeping under his desk or something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you break this?&rdquo; He asked me. He jerked the suitcase handle again and again, but it wouldn't go in fully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He kept doing it, violently. Man, I was praying for that handle to go in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you break it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix it,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took the suitcase from him and set it down, putting my hand into the siding of the case to feel the metal and using the other to try to get the handle in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to fix it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just put the stuff back into the other suitcase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did as he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need to get a job,&rdquo; he said once I had finished and looked up.</p>
<p>I agreed.</p>
<p>He told me to take a shower. I stood under the hot water, and I remember thinking about how I wanted to stay under the water forever, how good it would be if the hot water could soften me so I could start taking myself apart under it, like peel my lips off and pluck my nose off and step out of my loose skin and have my bones crumble like sandstone in my fingers and just go into the drain so I wouldn't leave a mess. Man, I was a burden.</p>
<p>Only work I found was writing for a magazine. They had an opening for an internship and wanted some writing samples. So I sent in a story about my travels to the editor. It's about how I came by some money, went like this:</p>
<p>The road was new and black with shiny crumbs on its shoulder that crunched as you walked on them. It had bold yellow dashes that were neatly squared off on each end. The road curved through the pine forest. The air was colder and fresher here because of the elevation. Before I had gotten to the ranch I made camp in the forest and woke up to frost on the outside of my sleeping bag. But the goose down had lofted overnight, and I only felt the cold wind as a gentle tugging. I imagined I was in the Pacific Northwest and that I was hiking through the primitive lushness of Washington with its big green dinosaur ferns, redwood trees with the soft wet bark, and the dark damp soil that made your steps quiet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were a lot of monarch butterflies before me now. They were like delicate orange leaves that never fell. When I was little I read about how every year millions of them migrated to a forest near Mexico City. I thought about how fantastic that forest must have been to attract them, and that it must have had magical qualities. Now I knew that I was in that place. There was a photo in the magazine of thousands of them covering a big tree. It would have been grotesque like it is with pillbugs swarming all over a river rock or spiders with hair-like legs floating on top of one another in a dark basement corner. But the monarchs were beautiful in the way that they opened and closed upon the tree trunks, and the labor with which they flew, wobbly like a wet newborn calf. They were the color of your eyelids when you lie in the sun with your eyes closed, and around their wings they were polka-dotted with black and white like a dress a little girl might wear. To read that every year they made a great journey from all around North America made me think they were brave. It was always a special moment whenever I saw one as a child, and I was always trying to catch them because I hated to see them leave.</p>
<p>A white car came around a bend and stopped for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo; The woman asked me as we drove. She was clean and neat with a gray blazer and her hair in a shiny bun. She looked about 35. Her car was clean, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-one,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Older than you,&rdquo; she smiled.</p>
<p>A few minutes into the ride she placed her hand on my thigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your legs,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you run?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to, but not anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's not common to wear shorts in Mexico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. But I'm traveling. It's more comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have pants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your backpack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I'll change in Toluca.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should change now.&rdquo; She pulled over suddenly and looked at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an old broken wall by the highway, and behind it was the pine forest with boughs of red-brown pine needles. It was dry and the ground was soft here and would have made a good place to camp. I went behind the wall with my jeans and put them on over my shorts. She poked her head behind the wall and walked toward me.</p>
<p>I held my hands up. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to pee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We got back in the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is something wrong?&rdquo; She asked me as we drove on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I'm just tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toluca 7 km, read a green sign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you learn Spanish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In school. And here in Mexico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard Asians have small penises. Is that true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go like this,&rdquo; She said after some time, and she lifted her arms shoulder-level.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She reached over slowly towards the water bottle between my legs. She placed her hand on my penis and squeezed. &ldquo;Is that okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told that story to a lot of people who thought it was funny, how that ride wasn't free, and was she hot, and everything. Part of that story is a lie, though, and I only ever told Axel the truth. I did get a ride from someone who touched me. That's true. But it wasn't a girl, it was a guy. But the saddest part of that story is that as he drove off, he stopped for a second, and I saw his hand drop a couple purple bills from the window. I went and got some tacos with that money and ate them on a big rock by the gas station. There were ants on that rock carrying green shards of leaves and I made a little game of trying to pick them up by their leaves and trading them with crumbs of beef from my taco.</p>
<p>The editor of the magazine called me and said I could write for them. She said I was &ldquo;exceedingly talented.&rdquo; Someone like her had never told me that before, and that made me feel pretty good. Started projecting way into the future about how this was the start of how I was going to be a great writer by paying my dues as a journalist. So I wrote a first draft, a self-important thing that they rejected and a second one, another self-important thing that they rejected again. Finally I wrote about meeting Aashik in Canc&uacute;n during my travels. They said it was very good, and that was a big relief for me. But apart from that I couldn't bring myself to write about things that were happening in Berkeley. They gave me one other story. This was during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The story was getting big because a couple Americans had gotten it at airports. Apparently the robotics department at Cal and a couple other schools were teaming up to fight it. I remember there was this one professor from Texas A&amp;M who said something like: "It's up to us to make a stand against Ebola." The funniest part of that story was thinking about all these college robots in West Africa, burying their dead and offering their condolences in their robotic voices. But I'm guessing the editors, they knew I was down and out, so I think they were just throwing me a bone.</p>
<p>I slept by my brother's bed on a twin mattress, right in front of the doorway. In the morning he stepped over me to go to work. It's painful being at someone's place when they're getting ready for work. My brother would always tell me to sleep on his bed as he was leaving. I put the mattress away when he left. He worked all day in finance. What exactly he did I never knew. ETF's, he said. He always came back really tired. When he did he would order food for us and we would watch a television show or a movie. We never talked, and he never asked me about my travels. Sometimes I cleaned his kitchen and bathroom, and sometimes I wrote. His windows were big and let in a lot of light. At night I took long walks through the city and listened to music.</p>
<p>My brother's the kind of guy who likes to give you a moral and say things like "At the end of the day." Like this one time we were going to get some coffee, and he gave this homeless guy outside the cafe a buck. Then he turned to me and said: "You know, you'd think it's bad to give to the homeless because they'll spend it on drugs or something, but at the end of the day, it's only a dollar."</p>
<p>In all seriousness, though, my brother went through a lot to get to where he is now. Smart guy, hard worker. Now he's making more in a year than I'll make in a lifetime. Man, my dad was a real bastard to him growing up, used to beat the shit out of him and tell him he was incompetent. I remember hiding with my sister while my brother cried and being glad I wasn't him. Hard life, no mistake. My brother used to be left-handed for example, and my dad beat that out of him, so now he's right-handed. I remember when I was little listening to my mom and dad talking at the dinner table about my being left-handed. My dad was saying, "How's he going to hold a gun?" And I remember sitting up against the wall thinking, "Man, when the war comes I'm gonna be pretty useless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One night, not too long after I arrived at my brother&rsquo;s apartment, he took me out to dinner. But first he said my shorts were too short, and he made me change. It was a nice place, everyone there looked pretty well-off. We were talking, and he was telling me that I should try to publish what I wrote on my website, about my travels. I told him I didn't know about that. To be honest, I didn't think it was publishable. I told him it wasn't the whole truth, that I had been through a lot more than what I put online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Man, I really suffered," I told him.</p>
<p>"You didn't suffer," he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How do you know that?"</p>
<p>"Because no one told you to go and because you could have come home anytime you wanted."</p>
<p>He said that if you went through something but didn't have to, it didn't count. It only counted if you had to go through it without a choice. The people in the Holocaust, those people really suffered.</p>
<p>What the hell do you know, I thought, and I started to cry at the table. People around us noticed I was crying, even the server who came to fill our glasses turned around when she saw my face, and my brother was embarrassed sitting there with me. We left quickly and I cried more when we got back to his place. I told him I didn't see the point anymore, and I asked him how he was able to find any meaning in anything. He said he had God, and I asked him how, and he said that it just clicked for him sometime in his sophomore year. What do you mean it just clicked? He didn't know, but it made sense to him. I could tell he didn't want to talk anymore, so we got ready for bed. I took the mattress out from under his bed, and we went to sleep. Couple days later I left my brother's house for the weekend and never went back.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>THAT&rsquo;S HOW I got to be back in Berkeley, walking home from Albatross after forgetting my wallet. I was crashing at Aashik and Axel's place now, sleeping on a red sleeping bag at the foot of Aashik's bed. They were cool with it, for the most part. I didn&rsquo;t see much of them anyway because they&rsquo;d leave the apartment around six or seven and spend all day on campus, going from class to library to class. Like I said, Axel was a pure math major and he was getting a music minor, too. Guy was in the goddamn choir, and they were always doing Requiem or Mass in B Minor. Aashik was a double major, too, business and economics, always doing work for a club or running some guy&rsquo;s senate campaign. Real smart, industrious guys, dean&rsquo;s list, a lot of friends, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A man was walking on the other side of Shattuck Ave. His legs crossed over themselves as he walked and he was walking into fire hydrants, trees, and the windows of stores to keep himself from falling. I jogged over and asked him if he was okay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He wouldn't look at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had him put his arm around me and we walked slowly together. He told me he lived near the Claremont Hotel which was a few miles away. He was short with gray hair and glasses. He wore a dark gray wool coat over his suit and carried a leather satchel. His name was John. I asked him what he did for a living.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I value and sell smaller companies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His legs twisted underneath him. I tried to grab his waist, but he fell on the cement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm a piece of shit,&rdquo; he said. He began to sob and to rock himself on the ground. &ldquo;I'm a piece of shit. I'm a piece of shit. I'm a fucking loser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I helped him up by the elbow. We started walking again. I asked him if he had kids.</p>
<p>He had a daughter and a son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son hates me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He hates the shit out of me. He's your age. He hates me. I'm a shit dad to him so he hates me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just never been around. My son hates me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re never around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of your job?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does your son like to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play guitar and smoke pot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he want to be a musician?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t want to be anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm a terrible father. My son hates me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We walked in silence. As we crossed a street John buckled at the knees and we wheeled as I tried to keep him upright. He lay on the asphalt. His face was blank when he looked at me, like a baby. I wondered if he was sober now. I helped him up and took his satchel from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what was your plan?&rdquo; I asked him. &ldquo;Were you just going to walk back home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wanted to feel something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Claremont Hotel&rsquo;s highest tower and its palm trees came into view. The hotel was all white and big and long and glowed blue-white at its base.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grunted.</p>
<p>Soggy brown leaves on the sidewalk clung to our shoes like wet paper. On the other side of the street a hooded, stooped woman shuffled home. Her face was tanned and wooden. Gray lines of hair came out of her hood. Her hands were in her pockets. She had thick short legs and small feet. She carried a tied plastic bag.</p>
<p>John's arm tightened on my shoulder. He was huffing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were in a rich neighborhood now. It was quiet except for the wind and the leaves at night. The houses were painted in dark colors and some had dark red brick on their first stories. They were large but not monstrous like those mansions you see in Southern California. They had large front yards with big lawns and old big trees that were older and bigger than the houses themselves. None of the lights were on in the houses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost there, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gonna remember me in the morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He snorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got a good story about you and your son?&rdquo; I asked him after some time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He didn't say anything for a minute, and I thought it was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is when my son was six or seven. It was after school. He'd just been diagnosed with diabetes. Doctor told him that he should start learning how to inject the insulin himself now because he'd have to start doing it for the rest of his life. That made him different to the other kids, and at first I think he got picked on a little. He was always a really shy kid. But he was always a little different, too. Like our collie Cleveland died one day. Old dog. My wife and I got him when we married. He died when my son was five, and for a good month he wouldn't stop acting like a dog. Wanted us to put him on a leash and eat from a dog bowl. Panting with his tongue out. Different. Anyway, we taught him how to use the needle, and this one day he had some friends over on our porch. I never saw these kids before, so I assumed he brought them over to show them something. Yeah, he was going to show them how he injected himself. They're all leaning over him, fascinated, and Caleb my son picks out a vein in his thigh and puts the needle in. But he can't get the insulin in because he hasn't got a good vein, so he tries again. And again, and again. So I'm just watching my son stab himself with a needle with this frozen look on his face, half joy, half, you know, horror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should&rsquo;ve taken that needle out of his hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he said. "I realize that it's not the story you were expecting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got any stories about you guys eating an ice cream or something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed a little. "Fuck off."</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said. We walked for a few minutes down a long lamp-lit driveway to his home. When we were before his front door he fell again, twisting away from me and landing on the cement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't deserve to live,&rdquo; he said. His eyes were wide and his mouth quivered. His hands were up to his chest like he thought I was going to hit him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, John. We&rsquo;re here now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We entered his kitchen, which seemed to have signs of a family. There was an electric guitar hanging in the living room and a big television on the wall. The refrigerator was made of stainless steel. The house was clean, the furniture was modern and unscuffed, and there were clean throws folded neatly on the sofas. It didn't look like anyone lived there. I listened for anyone upstairs, a light to come on and a woman&rsquo;s soft steps upon the stairwell and prepared to explain myself. But no one came. I found a glass in one of the cabinets on either side of his sink and filled it with water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drink as much as you can,&rdquo; I said and placed it in front of him on the granite island. "Is your wife home?"</p>
<p>"She's with another man now."</p>
<p>"Sorry to hear that."</p>
<p>"She cheated on me. I knew the guy, too, we both knew him. He was my friend."</p>
<p>"Damn."</p>
<p>"You don't do that to another man."</p>
<p>"Yeah. No."</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should get some sleep, right?&rdquo; I asked after some time.</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>I followed him upstairs and helped him into bed. I looked for anything feminine in his bedroom like a make-up mirror or a lavender bathrobe but saw nothing. His bedsheets were gray and white, and his bedframe and his nightstand were made of dark wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He motioned for me to give him my hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, thank you,&rdquo; he said and kissed it twice.</p>
<p>I took off his shoes and set them by his bed. He closed his eyes. I went to his bathroom to fill his glass and placed it on his nightstand. Then I switched off his light and left.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>SOMEONE I KNOW, she&rsquo;s got a sister whose husband killed himself after they got a divorce. I don&rsquo;t know all the details, but they found him in bed with pills. From what I heard, before the divorce, he&rsquo;d go to rehab for his drinking. He&rsquo;d be all chummy and ready to turn over a new leaf. Then when he got out he&rsquo;d start drinking again. He had a daughter who&rsquo;s five or six now. That little girl&rsquo;s family, they never told her what happened. They just told her that her dad got sick and now he&rsquo;s in heaven. I don&rsquo;t know, man. I mean, I get it: you want the kid to be a kid. You hate to see her down or to show her how bad the world can get. She&rsquo;s pure, for now. But on the other hand, I bet she knows something dark happened&mdash;look, to her family she&rsquo;s the manifestation of her dead dad&mdash;and she might not know that right now, but it&rsquo;s in her heart now, and you try and bury it deep inside her then she&rsquo;ll only let that thing grow, and pretty soon it&rsquo;ll come out, in one way or another. I bet she&rsquo;s asked herself over and over again: Why is he dead? How can you kill yourself?</p>
<p>How can you kill yourself?</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re little, killing yourself makes no sense because the world is beautiful. When I was little while my mom was running errands I used to lift up stepping stones to stare at centipedes with their red armor and their wriggling yellows legs, moist fat-banded earthworms half in the earth, glossy black stink bugs aiming their butts at us, rolly-pollies, pincher bugs, spiders and their white eggs webbed to the underside of the stone. Where I grew up, there were a lot of creeks, and that was a different world: water striders dimpled the water like it was made of glue. Sometimes I saw the tail of a water snake slithering away. One of the best things I&rsquo;ve ever seen is a water snake, about a foot and a half long, with its engorged mouth on one of the hind legs of a bullfrog. Big frog, size of my fist. The frog was crawling up onto the creek bank with the snake in the water. Its leg was all bloody. Man, I ran over to my dad shouting. I couldn&rsquo;t even make a sentence because of how excited I was. We watched the frog try to crawl up the bank, and I tried to throw rocks at the snake to let it go. My dad wouldn&rsquo;t let me. But I was so sure that the snake was bad for doing what it was doing. Poor frog, I thought, just trying to have a mudbath and catch some flies while this evil snake&rsquo;s trying to bite off his leg.</p>
<p>I remember the minnows darting and gliding smoothly to a stop. I could never catch them because they were too fast, faster than tadpoles. Beneath them red crawfish snapped backwards in plumes of tan dust. The creek floor was scattered with their shells and their antennae that looked like red wire. If you were lucky you might see a box turtle with red on its head and yellow-edged shapes on its shell or a yellow and a shiny black salamander resting on a wet rock. These, with the water snake, were the rarest creatures in the creek and to see one felt monumental, like seeing boobs in a movie. There were dark green frogs and purple-brown tadpoles whose spotted, translucent tails trembled in the water. They didn&rsquo;t look anything like each other, and I couldn&rsquo;t believe that they were the same thing. One swam like a fish and nibbled on weeds, and the other sat on its haunches and hopped on land and snapped its tongue to catch flies. But some of the tadpoles had gangly hind legs and tails that were starting to shrink into their fattening bodies, and you thought: so it&rsquo;s true then. Sometimes you saw a clump of clear, dotted jelly floating at the surface of the creek. If you looked closely you could see mini tadpoles, like commas, wriggling inside. One time I was reaching for some of these eggs in a creek and all of a sudden a small frog the size of my thumb jumped on my hand, and I remember trying to turn the thing over to see if it was the mom or the dad.</p>
<p>You could flatten your lungs to sit on a pool floor and feel both afraid and calm, and afterward your fingers would prune. Then later in the bath you could slick your hair up with shampoo. You could make shapes with your sister&rsquo;s long black hairs that were stuck to the shower wall, like the outlines of cars or the profiles of faces. When you let the water out and leaned over the drain you saw it swirl around like a mini-tornado, and it sounded like when you sucked the last of your soda with a straw. On long drives the Californian sun followed you the whole way. The chalky white moon was out, too, like a fossil in the blue sky. You knew your way around town not by street names but by landmarks, like the freeway exit by the soccer fields, the gas station at the intersection, its prices on big black lettering on illuminated yellow signs, the big patchy field of the big middle school you&rsquo;d go to one day, even though it you couldn&rsquo;t even imagine that day ever coming. But more than landmarks, you knew your way around by the feeling of a place. As you came back home late at night from the city, you went in and out of sleep for what seemed like days, but even in such a state you knew when you were pulling up to your home. Arriving felt like the end of a long journey, and falling asleep had the finality of death.</p>
<p>You woke with the freshness of the morning when the sky was still gray and the cold air made you feel rugged once you put on thick socks and a big sweatshirt over your pajamas. You didn&rsquo;t understand why your parents were so groggy in the morning, why they clung to sleep like it was better than life. You didn&rsquo;t have time to sleep because there were whole worlds to fall into, the worlds you created with your toys and the fantastic worlds of your books.</p>
<p>And you <em>felt</em>, man. You<em> felt</em>. There was the torturous anticipation of birthdays and Christmas. There was the darkly regal mood of a movie theater with its crimson curtains and carpet and the smell of popcorn. There was the nervous joy of your father lifting you up in the air, and the same feeling when your brother let you into his company. There was the joy of being your sister&rsquo;s best friend, how it felt like her presence was just an extension of yours. Board games and Fridays and cartoons. New books and movies whose worlds were richer than ours. There was the dark pleasure in thinking about running away from home, and how our parents would be sorry then. When we lost a game or when our parents scolded us our tears were hot and our fists were tight. When we cried there was nothing but the feeling that everything was against us, and sometimes we could not stop crying. It took over us like a storm, and all we could do was endure it. But afterward our minds would be strangely clear. There was the exhilaration of seeing the girl you liked sit down at her seat in the morning. There was the joy of running out to play soccer with your friends at recess. There was the war-like will to win and the bitterness of defeat. You felt the brotherhood in defending your goal with your teammates and the courage of your goalkeeper. You felt the treachery of their betrayal if they switched teams. You felt the graveness of being down a goal as time ran out, and the desperation as your attempts to score failed. But when you struck the ball into the back of the net like it was something you hated, there was a second when you felt like you were underwater. Then pure joy took over you and your teammates and you ran around the field to everyone cheering.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what happened to that little girl&rsquo;s father that made him do it, but I bet it was pretty cold and bleak in his head when did. I bet he had never been more alone. I bet he had pain his whole life, I bet the world was also beautiful for him when he was a kid like it was for all of us, but that things started getting bad when he forgot how to see. And before his little girl was wondering how you could kill yourself, he was wondering how you couldn&rsquo;t. One hard morning, the white light coming in too bright, the booze not enough, daughter not enough, the pain he&rsquo;d give to everyone around him if he did it not enough, he got that orange bottle from his medicine cabinet where it&rsquo;s been sitting there glowing for a while now. Then he goes back into bed. Takes more than enough pills to see it through and looks around his room and sees everything like it&rsquo;s for the first time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens to us that the world stops being beautiful? I figure you get a blank dictionary when you&rsquo;re born. Everything is new, everything has meaning, and you have these really rich and full days where you&rsquo;re touching and licking and playing with everything to get that dictionary filled in. I&rsquo;m thinking that&rsquo;s why children look dead when they&rsquo;re asleep, like they&rsquo;re way into a dream. But as you get older there are fewer and fewer new things. You find that you already have a definition for certain things. So instead of interacting with the real world, you just look up your definition of the thing you&rsquo;re interacting with. Pretty soon you got a definition for almost everything there is in the world. People, places, things, ideas, physical sensations, emotions. When you were little, the world was a big mystery. But when you&rsquo;re an adult, it&rsquo;s all gray and rigid because you already have every definition. Or so you think. What you really have is the same bad dictionary that everyone around you has. You forget that you once had very good definitions that came from your own dealings with the world, and that they were what made life fun. But you throw them away because someone in your school makes fun of you for liking something, or because your parents fight in front of you and you&rsquo;re thinking: Man, I&rsquo;ve been a fool not knowing the way things really are, and you scramble to redefine things. Fear, that&rsquo;s what makes us give up our own definitions, fear of everyone talking behind your back about how you&rsquo;re a freak.</p>
<p>There is a right definition for every thing. I&rsquo;m thinking that&rsquo;s what artists mean when they&rsquo;re talking about truth, that&rsquo;s what Rilke meant when he was talking about how he was learning how to see. But when you only got that bad dictionary that everyone else has you notice that in comparison to your childhood days you feel much less, you feel that there&rsquo;s nothing new left in the world, that you just go about your day hopping from definition to definition. I mean, that&rsquo;s why we drink and do drugs, that&rsquo;s why we want to fall in love, because for a brief time you have the right definitions again. Makes you a kid, gives you a different set of eyes. Makes you like people, makes you interested in them, makes you a better talker and a better listener, and it makes you forget about your troubles. World&rsquo;s beautiful again.</p>
<p>But without these things, time starts to move faster and faster. A year as an adult is shorter and more forgettable than the length of a child&rsquo;s full day. You might start to like being asleep more than you like being awake. Maybe one morning you&rsquo;ll squirm to be more comfortable on the red sleeping bag because you didn&rsquo;t bother to get out of your jeans, and there&rsquo;s a crinkling as you shift and you reach into your back pocket and find those bar receipts that you picked up for John the night before.</p>
<p>Man, the mornings were tough. When the light comes in, you can&rsquo;t kid yourself anymore. You think: What kind of performance am I going to have put on for myself today? Every morning I&rsquo;d wake up thinking I was going to make something of the day. Yes, yes, yes, I&rsquo;d think to myself. Then it was like I had all these voices telling me I should make myself a little drink from the rum we had leftover from a party, that I should listen to some music, watch a little video.</p>
<p>Most of the time I&rsquo;d fantasize. There&rsquo;s this scene in the movie <em>King of Comedy</em> where De Niro&rsquo;s in his basement pretending that he&rsquo;s having dinner with this famous comedian who&rsquo;s trying to convince him to take over his show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just for six weeks,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible! I can&rsquo;t even take over my own life for six weeks!&rdquo; De Niro says. &ldquo;What d&rsquo;ya want, the tears to come outta my eyes?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then his mom calls him from upstairs. &rdquo;Rupert! What are ya doing down there? Who&rsquo;re ya talking to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma-aa!&rdquo; He yells. &ldquo;Puh-<em>lease</em>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a funny scene, clever too, because at first you think it&rsquo;s real. But watching that made me want to scratch myself out of my skin. Because that&rsquo;s what I was doing all day, man, all day. I&rsquo;m serious. Way more pathetic than that, too. And more evil shit, that I won&rsquo;t get into, stuff that I&rsquo;m not proud of. There&rsquo;s that one Star Trek episode of <em>Black Mirror</em> where this anti-social programmer guy has his own virtual world. Somehow with DNA samples of everyone in his office, he&rsquo;s able to clone them perfectly into his world, which takes place on a spaceship called the USS Callister. That&rsquo;s the name of the episode. This programmer, he&rsquo;s the captain of the ship, and he can do whatever he wants with his co-workers including his boss who shits on him and this new cute girl he clones in. But he&rsquo;s just an ass to them, doesn&rsquo;t even give them genitalia. I thought that was pretty convenient. Think about it, if a messed up guy like that programmer could be the God of his own goddamn <em>world</em>, what do you think he&rsquo;s going to do to his boss and that cute girl and all the women in the office? It&rsquo;s going to get dark real quick. I mean, I get it, you can&rsquo;t make it too messed up. But man, the inside of your head, that&rsquo;s where you <em>are</em> the God of your world, and it can get real evil and sad in there, and maybe you think it&rsquo;s your own little secret, but it all comes out in one way or another. What I&rsquo;m trying to say is that <em>King of Comedy</em>, <em>Callister</em>&mdash;that&rsquo;s baby shit. You get inside the head of a pretty good guy, you&rsquo;ll find sicker stuff than that. And I was sick, man, real sick.</p>
<p>But the morning, the morning was too early for anything serious. I would have a couple moments of conviction as I listened to music. Then I would have a drink as a reward for having a moment like that. I drank what alcohol I could find in the kitchen, and I&rsquo;d look at stupid shit on the internet.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t focus, man, not on anything. I just couldn&rsquo;t do it. I&rsquo;m thinking I had some attention problems, sure, and if I had more modern parents they&rsquo;d have put me on some drugs for sure. Thank God they didn&rsquo;t. Real genius move, drugging your kid because he can&rsquo;t sit still. The real problem is that that there was nothing to focus on. No point. I remember reading about how during the French Revolution this one asylum emptied out because all the patients went to join. Some life-or-death stuff was happening, I figure, so they finally had some kind of purpose. That&rsquo;s the problem with today, man, the stakes are too low for anyone to care. I kind of felt giddy dropping out of school, because everyone makes it out to be this big thing like you&rsquo;re throwing your life away, but when you do it you realize that nothing&rsquo;s changed. It&rsquo;s kind of like when you&rsquo;re in the middle of a nightmare. Other night I was dreaming of driving a car on this mountain road, and for whatever reason I always drive it off a cliff like I&rsquo;m on a track to thin air. So I&rsquo;m in the air waiting to die, and then I wake up. I wake up and still half-asleep, I&rsquo;m thinking about how much it&rsquo;s going to hurt, like my head going through the windshield, and that it&rsquo;d be better to die than to be in a wheelchair. Then I think: wait a minute, all that&rsquo;s null now, and I feel real light and giddy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d spend the morning drinking until I felt the warmth of Alex&rsquo;s presence. Then it&rsquo;d be time for my nap. I&rsquo;d stumble over to my sleeping bag on the floor of Aashik&rsquo;s room, and Alex would be there beside me. I would kiss my forearm as if it were her shoulder. I would bring her hips toward mine. I felt such a tenderness for her, I wanted to tuck my head into her neck and smell the roots of her hair behind her ear just as I used to. It smelled faintly of fennel, like her mouth did in a deep kiss. I wanted to tell her everything, man, I wanted to tell her that I had nothing going for myself and that it was hard to imagine living like this for the rest of my life. I wanted her to tell me that none of this was true and how could I think that? I&rsquo;d nestle deeply into this warm world and go through my fantasies before choosing one that would take me away:</p>
<p><em>Her face is flushed and shiny as it is when she&rsquo;s out of breath or after we&rsquo;ve made love. She has a box in her arms. She holds it above her swollen belly. She sets the box down with the others and wipes her temple with her sleeve. I take her hands and we slide in our socks across the empty wooden floor.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;No rules?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;No rules,&rdquo; she smiles.</em></p>
<p>Waking up&rsquo;s the worst part of being alive. Man, consciousness just comes into your head like a poison, like you&rsquo;ve just heard some really bad news which I guess is that you&rsquo;re you. Makes you wish you were dead, and all you can do is lie there until it goes away.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think I'd be better off in prison. Maybe I could get something done if someone locked me in a cell for a couple years. Every Tuesday my library&rsquo;s got this used book sale. Every book&rsquo;s either fifty cents or a dollar, depending on if its a paperback or a hardcover, and every time I go there I get a couple books. I figure it&rsquo;s all the adult children of the old people clearing out their childhood homes when they die and donating all their books to the library. That&rsquo;s my guess because every so often you&rsquo;ll open up a nice edition of a classic and you&rsquo;ll find an inscription. Other day I bought a nice hardcover poetry book, and when I opened it I saw that someone had written, in really nice handwriting that no one&rsquo;s got anymore:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 1;"<center><p>Al,</p>
<p>Warm friends lie within these pages ...</p>
<p>Happy Anniversary, with love.</p>
<p>Connie</p>
<p>7.7.82</p></center>>
<p>It&rsquo;s sad to see, because you can kind of tell when no one&rsquo;s read a book before because none of the pages are bent and they still smell new. But I get it. Reading&rsquo;s hard. I&rsquo;ve got hundreds of books now, and I&rsquo;ve only read a couple dozen of them. One of the books I had with me while I was travelling through Central America was <em>The Brothers Karamazov. </em>That&rsquo;s a big book. I remember telling you that I was reading it, and you were asking me what the damn epigraph meant and who my favorite character was. Yeah, I never read that goddamn book. Ended up giving it to a Cuban named Magdial in Nicaragua. How I met that guy is a long story, so I&rsquo;ll start with how I got into Nicaragua.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to enter Belize because I had no entry stamp into Mexico, so I climbed a fence in a duty-free strip of stores close to the border and walked a few miles through jungle until I got to a highway in Belize. There are dirt paths near every border that locals use to go between countries, and I used them to cross into Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua.</p>
<p>They caught me at the border of Honduras and Nicaragua. I came out of one of those trails onto the road and an immigration car stopped me and asked me for my papers. I told them I&rsquo;d been hiking in the hills and didn&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;d crossed the border. They took me back to the office and searched my things. I palmed a little bag of weed from my pack and put it in my pocket while I was helping them take my things out. They told me I had to pay $70. I said I didn&rsquo;t have any money. They said to come back with some, but that they&rsquo;d keep my passport with them. I told them they couldn&rsquo;t do that, but they wouldn&rsquo;t give it back to me. I shouted at the man that I needed it to survive and to please give it back. He did but took my driver&rsquo;s license. I went back onto the trail and came out about a mile ahead of where I had the last time and continued into Nicaragua.</p>
<p>A family of five in an old pick-up truck took me a few miles before the Costa Rican border which is called Pe&ntilde;as Blancas. I sat in the back on some boxes of lettuce with an old man and his two grandsons. The calm shore of Lago de Managua was only twenty feet away on our left, and it looked like it must flood the road when it rained. The gray-brown volcanoes Concepci&oacute;n and Maderas were on the lake's island Ometepe. They were stout and matte and looked flat against the horizon. There were a lot of active volcanoes along the coastline of Nicaragua, and they smoked and rumbled the towns. At night when everyone was inside their homes, there was a strange silence in the towns. The insects and birds were silent, and you only heard the hum of electricity. I felt that rumbling inside of me, like something big was about to happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wind took our words from our mouths so we pointed at the lake and the volcanoes and smiled. We stopped a few times to cool the engine with water. There were mango trees along the road. Each tree was forty feet high and carried hundreds of small plump yellow mangoes. There were hundreds of them on the ground, some rotten and swarming with ants and already part of the ground and others that were mottled and soft and goldenrod. It was easy to kick some leaves around to find the good ones, and we returned to the truck bed with them in the bellies of our shirts. We started up again. Warm syrupy juice spiraled away into the air as we sucked on the mangoes. The pulp stuck in my bottom teeth. The boys and I made a game of throwing the slimy flat stones as far as we could into the dry fields. If you threw it like you were skipping stones on a lake shore then it cut nicely through the wind before it fell curving down. The grandfather smiled at us and gave me a bag of water. It was cold and dripping. I tore into the plastic with my teeth and emptied it down my throat. He put his hand out for the plastic and smiled as I wiped my mouth.</p>
<p>They let me off at the border. I doubled back and turned west into the yellow grazing fields and hiked through a few miles of light and dry jungle. The roots of the trees here were dry and came off the ground like thick, dusty vines. There were a few cattle fences too, along the way, three or four horizontal, barbed wires held up by vertical branches that I jumped over. I decided to stay west of the highway entering Costa Rica and to keep it in sight. I hopped over a dry riverbed. There was a tree whose roots were like that of mangroves, though there was no river here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Ey!&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>I startled. A man sat in the shade of a big tree. He had a white LA cap, a purple shirt, and white shorts. He said his name was Charlie and tossed his passport at my feet. It was true. He said he&rsquo;d been waiting in the grove for a friend who was coming illegally from Costa Rica into Nicaragua. His friend was bringing Charlie's girlfriend. She's black, he said, so it's more dangerous for her. He said that just beyond the clearing were patrols of Nicaraguan military and Costa Rican immigration. They were staking the river that bridged the border because it was a point of territorial dispute for the two countries. They were also on the lookout for illegals. Charlie said he would guide me part of the way and that he had crossed four or five times already. He said it would be dark in an hour.</p>
<p>We sat under the tree. I told him about my travels and showed him some pictures on my camera. I told him I wanted to get to the World Cup in Brazil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;La Mundial? Puta. There are a lot of black women in Brazil, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably. More than here.&rdquo; I reached into my bag and tossed him a mango. His eyes lit up when he caught it, and we ate together.</p>
<p>We began before it was completely dark, before the hills and the trees were black with the night sky. Charlie walked fast. His arms swung loosely. I hunched myself as I followed him and I clutched my backpack straps if I had to run. About an hour in we saw a man in white leaning against a tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shh, shh,&rdquo; Charlie said. &ldquo;Inmigraci&oacute;n.&rdquo; He began to approach the figure like he was going to play a prank on him. Then he spun around suddenly and sprinted past me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Ey! Ey!&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>We ran through the brush, swishing noisily. I hadn&rsquo;t eaten that day besides those mangoes and was weak and hungry. We bounded over tall grass. I felt my heartbeat hitting at my temple. I looked back and saw a wild beam of light flailing into the night sky like an unleashed hose. We dropped onto our stomachs and breathed silently into the ground. Dust entered my mouth. I gathered spit in my mouth and let it drip down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did he stop?&rdquo; I whispered to Charlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s afraid,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There are robbers around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We moved parallel to the highway. Charlie patted his pockets and cursed. He had lost his phone and his passport. I told him we could go back and look for them where we were lying down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They're gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We saw two more white officials walking the opposite direction on the path to our left, about fifty feet away. Military and immigration travel in pairs, he whispered to me. I asked Charlie to take of his white cap and his white shorts. He took off his shorts and wrapped his cap in them. Then three figures carrying bags passed quickly by us on the path. They didn&rsquo;t notice us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Ey!&rdquo;</em> Charlie whispered.</p>
<p>They were two men and one women also crossing the border. They were sharp and wary, and they walked on quickly. We walked fast once they were some distance away. I wanted to think we were safe now. I wanted to see homes and lights and stores.</p>
<p>Charlie stopped. He said he was going back now because the way was clear now. I thanked him. I saw him walk back. I moved on. Then two black figures approached. They had the stocky builds of soldiers in uniform. The nozzles of big guns came out of their silhouettes. We stopped and looked at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Ey! Ey!&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>I ran toward the brush. Charlie had told me they wouldn't shoot. He said they would only shoot into the sky as a warning. I ran through the brush toward the highway. My backpack bounced up and down, and I cursed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Ey! Ey! Ey!&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>I waited for a bullet in my back. I wondered if it would penetrate my backpack, my laptop and my clothes and all of the small things along the way. I heard them in the brush behind me. Then I was stuck. There were vines across my legs. I tried to burst through them, but they were too strong. I grunted and kept pushing with my legs and dug them into the ground. I could hear them getting closer so I bounced off the vines and fell backward on the ground. I growled and righted myself and ran again. Then I tripped on a root and they were above me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Don't move! Don't move!</em>&rdquo; A gun was dug into my chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Okay okay okay okay okay!</em>&rdquo; I said. I put my hands on the nozzle of the gun. Man, I never had a gun on me before. I wondered if a bullet could go through both my hands and into my body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Don't move!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Okay okay okay okay. </em>Okay.&rdquo; I lay still.</p>
<p>They pulled me up. One of them grabbed a fistful of my shirt. His nails dug into my chest. He put his light on my legs. I looked down and saw that there were many long curving cuts on my thighs. The tops of my socks were yellow and red. I looked at the vines I could not break through and saw that it was a barbed cattle fence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pobrecito,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He put the light in my face. &ldquo;De donde eres?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Los Estados Unidos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&iquest;Americano?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;S<a href="https://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/the-meaning-of/spanish-word-si.html">&iacute;</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to the other one. &ldquo;&iquest;Americano?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was taken back the way I came. They asked me how much I was paid to guide the others. I told them I wasn&rsquo;t guiding them. They told me to call for the others. I told them I didn&rsquo;t know their names. They told me to call for the others. I told them I didn&rsquo;t know their names.</p>
<p>They brought me to a military post. It looked like an old abandoned home with corroborated roof and concrete floors. The captain there shined a light up and down my body and stopped at my legs. He whistled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While you were running?&rdquo; He asked. He was a big Spanish man with a mustache. He had on the green uniform and black leather boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Can I have some water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain called to the two men for water. They brought a plastic jug to him. He drank from it for a long time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahhh,&rdquo; he said when he finished, and he wiped his mouth. He handed me the jug. There was only a little left.</p>
<p>We went inside the house which was bare except for a table and two chairs. He had to sit down with his legs far apart because his thighs looked like they were going to burst. There were cracks in the floor and yellow tufts of grass growing out of them. The house smelled earthy and dusty from the dried bat feces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you run?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard your men &hellip;&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t know how to say &ldquo;cock their guns&rdquo; in Spanish so I said &ldquo;<em>chik-chik</em>&rdquo; and mimicked the action.</p>
<p>He frowned. He took out his walkie-talkie and asked one of the men who brought me if this was true.</p>
<p>He turned to me. &ldquo;He says he dropped his gun. He says that's what you heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mentiroso,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>He made a note of everything in my backpack. He even counted all the change I had. If I struck him in the head hard enough, I thought, I might be able to escape. But I&rsquo;ve never struck anyone in the head before.</p>
<p>I was driven to a military base in the back of a convoy with another soldier. I thought about jumping out of the back. The soldier saw my eyes and told me to calm down. The metal gates of the base opened into a large concrete yard. They brought me into a drab, dusty room. It looked like an old principal&rsquo;s office. There were a lot of crates with files and an old computer turned to its side in the room. An old man with bushy gray eyebrows sat behind a desk there. His uniform had a lot of stars and tassels. He asked me who I was, very close to my face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you <em>efeh beh ee</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you efeh beh ee?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Efeh beh ee? Efeh beh ee, FBI? No! I'm a student,&rdquo; I said in Spanish. &ldquo;I'm traveling!&rdquo; I forced myself to laugh. I reached into my wallet for my student ID. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can read,&rdquo; he said. He stared at me. He asked me how much I was paid to guide the others, who they were, how I knew the way into Costa Rica.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I told him I knew nothing about that.</p>
<p>He searched through all of my things and took photos of everything. He had problems working the flash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want flash, man,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He went through my notebook and took photos of some pages. I sat up in my seat to see which ones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your diary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you worried I'm taking pictures of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's my diary. It&rsquo;s personal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You write a lot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. You?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told me to empty my backpack out onto the table. I left some small things in the pockets. He took my backpack upside down and shook it onto the table. He took photos of my cuts and mugshots of my profiles. A medic took me into another room. She used one tongue depressor to spread the white cream over my cuts. Then she dipped it into the jar again and again.</p>
<p>We drove to the border immigration office a few miles north. I was questioned again. It was close to midnight. They went through my backpack again and made a note of everything that was inside. They sent me to sit on a bench in the lobby. Some of them came over and took photos of my thighs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would be taken to Managua tomorrow morning. They took me to a cell in the back of the building. There were two bunk beds with thin blue mattresses. There was a cot for the guard outside my cell. There was a woman who was white with curly hair and rectangular glasses. She asked me what had happened. I told her. She told me to put my hands through the barred window on the door. She held them in hers gently and examined my cuts and asked me more questions. I was too tired for that. Another official came in and told me to give him his hands. He handcuffed me. Orders, he told me. I asked him if he would give me a book out of my backpack. I have three, I said. No.</p>
<p>There were the messages and tags of other apprehended illegals written on the white cinder block walls. There were names with dates and quotes. Some of them were only a few days old.</p>
<center><p>Trust in the Lord with all your heart</p>
<p>and lean not on your own understanding.</p>
<p>In all your ways submit to him,</p>
<p>and he will make your paths straight.</p>
<p>- James, Ghana</p></center>
<p>I lay on one of the bunks with my cuffed hands on my chest and my knees up so the blood and cream would not get on the mattress. I felt the metal bars of the bunk under me. I was thinking about how great it would be if I could stop time. In the morning I&rsquo;d uncuff myself. Then I&rsquo;d find my passport and stamp it twice for entry and exit. Then I&rsquo;d walk south, take a car and drive for a few days. Race down the aisles of grocery stores in shopping carts and eat whatever I want. But if time was stopped then wouldn&rsquo;t air molecules be suspended? So how could I breathe? Did matter beyond my body keep their properties when time was stopped? Was water still wet, was the sun still hot, did air molecules vibrate to make sound? Would I be able to swim or would the ocean look like water but have the properties of ice? It shouldn&rsquo;t be possible to disturb matter when time was stopped. Otherwise the matter I disturbed would impact other matter which would impact other matter. Did time stop for my organs? Would food go bad? No, the food would never go bad. It would never be hard or impossible to move. I&rsquo;d spend a week on the beach, find a room in a great hotel and eat anything I wanted. The water would be normal moving water so I could swim. The mosquitoes would leave me alone. I could practice riding a motorcycle for a few days, I could learn how to fly a small plane and go around the world, I could come back home old.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>4.</p>
<p>IN THE MORNING, still handcuffed, they took me in a nice white pick-up to the detention center in Managua a few hours north. Are these really necessary, I said with my hands out. It was just a little joke for myself. The car smelled new inside and had air-conditioning. I was thinking it would have been a nice ride past the lake and the volcanoes again if I weren&rsquo;t going to jail. The center was a plain single-story building, almost like a library you&rsquo;d find in a small town in the midwest. I hiked up my shorts to expose my cut thighs when I entered. Everyone stared at me and then at my legs. There were about 40 detainees. They were men from Bulgaria, Ethiopia, Ghana, Somalia, Syria, Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Tibet, Cuba, and Peru. They were refugees who were making their way up to America by seeking asylum in each country along the way.</p>
<p>There was Magdial from Cuba, Adnan from Syria, James from Ghana, and Chris from Oklahoma. He was the only other American. I can&rsquo;t remember the names of any others, though I do remember their faces. But a name anchors a face. Without it a face eventually blurs into a soft, ethnic composite. Of the forty men I was the only one traveling south. Everyone but Oklahoman Chris was going north to America. He was a short and stout man, and there was something motherly about him. I told him it was good to meet another American and to speak English. He had been taken in by the police because he was drunk in the streets of Honduras, and without a passport, had been brought here. He said he had a Honduran wife and kids and a hog farm. I asked him what was going to happen to him. He was sad when he said that he would probably have to leave his family and go back to America.</p>
<p>Countrymen stayed together. Ghanaians played ping-pong in the courtyard. The ball had a hairline fracture and bounced dead sometimes. Indians played cards in the yard, Bangladeshis puffed smoke out the barbed-wire fence toward an empty lot. Magdial, Adnan, and I spent our time together. Adnan was a tall and serious man with a shaved head. He was an accountant who&rsquo;d left Syria&rsquo;s civil war a few months ago. Magdial, who was from Cuba, told me about how he had flown into Brazil from Havana. For six months he and Adnan had made their way north. With a local guide they had hired, he and a group of other refugees crossed the Darien Gap by foot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fucking FARC, man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;During a river crossing with only a line of rope from bank to bank, an old man had nearly drowned. Just go yourself, he told Magdial. But Magdial managed to drag him through and they lay on the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was our lives, man! Our lives! Fuck! For me, this isn&rsquo;t traveling. For me this is life and death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he asked me why I hadn&rsquo;t just crossed legally I didn&rsquo;t have an answer. I felt pretty dumb. As an American I had to pay a fine of $80. Aashik wired me the money immediately and another $70 on top of that. Some of the other men wouldn&rsquo;t be processed for weeks. A tall Bulgarian man with the severe nose told me he had been caught at the border and sent to prison for six months before he arrived at the detention center. He showed me the bedsores on his sides from having to sleep on the bare floor.</p>
<p>James from Ghana slept across from me. He was always lying in his bed and looking up at the bunk above him. Whenever he walked by me I&rsquo;d give him a nod. He&rsquo;d just look at me. I thought he was sick or in pain or something. I saw him kneeling by his bed on the second day, and when he was done and had dusted his knees I asked him if he was praying. He nodded and said he was Christian. I told him I had seen the verse he had written in the bunk room. He spread peanut butter on a slice of bread and gave it to me. The inmates were allowed to pay the immigration officials to buy food for them. It was with Adnan his third week in the detention center.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my country this is jail,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In my country I am a good man. For me this is jail. I have never even been to jail, but this is jail for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told me that some of his friends and extended family were in New York. He had seen photos of them online about how they lived now. He said he wouldn&rsquo;t live like them. He said he would save up all his money and send it back to his wife and children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she plays games with me, man. She plays games with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the guy started to cry. I didn&rsquo;t know what to do. All I could do was look at him.</p>
<p>Magdial told me that when he saw my legs he thought I had been tortured, that I was Yakuza, which pleased me. He told me to pile two of the thin mattresses on the bunk because sleeping with only one would make you feel the metal bars underneath.</p>
<p>There was one woman whose name I never learned. She slept alone in the female quarters. She had a mohawk, not the spiky kind, but a thick strip that ended in a mullet. On the whiteboard in the yard she drew fake Chinese symbols, skull-and-crossbones, and the word &ldquo;revolucion&rdquo; over and over. At night we heard her howl and curse in Spanish. Some of the men shouted back. <em>Shut the fuck up, crazy bitch. </em>But no one knew why she was here, and we were afraid of her.</p>
<p>In the yard we played rummy and ate lunch. It was always some form of rice and beans, and it was better than I had been eating the past couple months. The woman approached me and said that she was a doctor who could treat the cuts on my thighs. She placed her hands on my calves. I told her I was okay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't let her touch you, dude,&rdquo; Magdial whispered to me. &ldquo;It was drugs. Drugs made her into a crazy bitch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The white cream had attracted gray dust and combined with my brown blood into a dry gravy that flaked off my thighs. Adnan and Magdial told me I needed to see a doctor. But I knew it wasn&rsquo;t serious. There were many cuts, but none of them were deep or swollen. I carefully rinsed them in the dribbling shower each day and in the afternoon I lay in the sun to dry them.</p>
<p>There was a small television in the room. The men were fixed on it. They stared at the pop stars dispatching villains in their music videos, celebrities sharing self-effacing anecdotes to adoring hosts and audiences, chefs adding handsome vegetables to blenders.</p>
<p>I tried to read a little. They wouldn&rsquo;t let us bring our things in, but they let me bring in a book when I flipped through the pages for them and showed them there was nothing inside. I got in my bunk and lay there trying to read the first page. Magdial came over on his way to the bathroom and looked at the cover.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Brothers Karamazov?&rdquo; He said. He said it like a real Russian would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was really excited and said it was his favorite book and that he&rsquo;d been meaning to read it again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s so much soul in him, man. If you want soul, all you need is Dostoesvky,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;&lsquo;God and the devil rage, man, and their battlefield is the heart of man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was my last day in the center, and I figured I&rsquo;d never get around to reading the book anyway, so I gave it to him. He was really happy, like I&rsquo;d just given him a hundred bucks. One of the Bangladeshis was lying in bed with a cigarette. I offered him some change for one, but he said it was okay. We smoked as we lay in our bunks. There were no more good stories to tell one another. The ceiling fan clicked and took the smoke away. There were the squeals of our droopy spring mattresses, the soft pound of chalky feet on the blasted concrete, the traffic beyond, and the clean metronomic clucks of ping pong in the yard. Murmurs in Spanish, Hindi, Arabic, and Somali blended low. I wrote and rewrote lists and drew and redrew calendars of what I was going to do with the next two years of my life. In the summer I would go to Alaska where my friend John was. I had met him when I worked during the winter at a ranch in northern California. I would walk the docks every morning and ask for a job on a salmon boat. If I couldn&rsquo;t get one I would gut fish in a cannery. When I had enough money I&rsquo;d go buy land in a forest in Montana or Idaho. I&rsquo;d build a small cabin near a stream with clear cold water I could use to cook and drink. I&rsquo;d get the right tools and learn how to use them. I&rsquo;d get a book on the local flora and fauna and forage for berries and mushrooms and fish and hunt small game and cook it on a wood stove. The stove would warm the cabin, too, and I would be warm in my sleeping bag at night. I would bring all my books and make a big bookshelf for them, too. Being alone like that in the middle of a forest, it&rsquo;d be painful and I&rsquo;d probably go crazy, but maybe it&rsquo;d let me get a grip.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m thinking it would be better to be in prison because the whole time in that detention center I wanted to make something out of my life. Man, I could never believe how fast the day went by. Do you ever think about how fast a whole 24 hours can go by? Sure, most people have eight hours of sleep and eight hours of work. But you still got that extra eight hours. I was thinking about how hard it&rsquo;d be to sit still for an hour with your eyes closed, and how that hour would seem longer than a week. That&rsquo;s how my days went, it&rsquo;d be dark before I get could a grip on getting a grip. Time for a walk, listen to some tunes. Fantasies are a lot better when you have a soundtrack.</p>
<p>I was wearing the same thing I was wearing the night before when I helped John out, just a hoodie and some jeans. There was a blackout on campus that night. Someone had stolen copper wire from some place outside campus and had caused an explosion on campus, came out of one of those steam vents. A man-sized fireball, I heard. I thought about a bunch of rats going <em>scree, scree, scree</em> as they&rsquo;re burnt alive. I looked it up and apparently the price of copper has been going up over the past couple years and that you could get a lot for that wire. What really interested me was the guy who orchestrated it all. I mean, who do you know who&rsquo;s got the brains to monitor copper prices and find out where there&rsquo;s a lot of it <em>and</em> got the balls to break the law like that? That&rsquo;s a guy who likes life. I figured it was a good night to walk around campus because there would be nobody there and it&rsquo;d be pitch black. Your place feels different when there&rsquo;s a blackout, right? I don&rsquo;t know if the science backs it up, but when there&rsquo;s no electricity, or maybe when you know there&rsquo;s no electricity, it feels different. Feels calm, really calm, all the way to the bottom of your lungs like when you take a long drag. When I was little we had a community pool that I&rsquo;d go down to at night with a piece of a plastic hose we used for the aquarium. I&rsquo;d sit at the bottom of the pool and use the hose as a snorkel. I&rsquo;d sit there and feel calm.</p>
<p>Last time I felt like that was on an island I worked on in Panama. One day the men left for mainland for some tools, and I stayed behind. I felt that excitement like when you have a big house to yourself. That night I made a fire on the east side of the island near the stucco frame house. I set up my pad by it and lay down. I wrote a little by the fire and listened to the waves below. They rasped when the tide sucked them in and sprayed upon the rock walls of the cliff. When I was little before I went to sleep I&rsquo;d have these images of being on a lifeboat on the slope of a wave that was gathering itself hundreds of feet into the air. The thought of awaiting death in this way terrified me and I&rsquo;d lay pinned to my bed.</p>
<p>I felt something touch my sleeping bag. It was a blue crab about the size of my hand. It had those beady snail eyes. I got a saucepan from the house and trapped the crab beneath the pan. Then I used a spatula to scrape the crab into the pan. I poured oil on the pan and held it over the fire. The oil began to spit out of the pan, and the crab became a violent shiny red with blue-gray still on its edges and legs. I broke it apart with a rock and pulled out the soft white meat. It was sweet, salty, and moist, and good because you had to work for it and because there was so little.</p>
<p>It was a small island on the Pacific coast of Panama. You could make a loop around the whole thing in an hour. It rose about twenty feet from the ocean, and a strip of white beach framed it like a moat. It was covered in dry jungle, except where it had been cleared, and was somewhere between tropical and Mediterranean in vegetation and climate. It had the laziness of coastal Spain or Greece in its dryness and sunlight, but in May the rain began, and every day we had an afternoon shower. There were two dark and big avocado trees in the center of the island, close to the main hut. They were at least thirty feet high, and their leaves were purple and leathery. Hundreds of avocados in a tree like black jewels, big rough-skinned avocados like the ones they have in supermarkets. One of the trees bore fruit with darker, purple-green shells and it was creamier and softer than the fruit of the other tree, whose shells were smooth and green like zucchini and whose fruit was unripe. Scattered about the island were also four or five papaya trees. The trees were thin and only had a few leaves, and if you gave them time they swelled with a single melon-sized fruit that looked too heavy for its thin trunk, like a slender woman who&rsquo;s big with child. They were unripe if they were green and the same powdery color as their big star-shaped leaves, but when they became orange or yellow you tapped the fruit with a long pole so that it swayed and the weak stem gave. You had to catch the melon in your shirt and bring it quickly away from you to cradle it like a lacrosse stick or it would burst when it hit the ground. When you split the fruit there was the faint smell of bile, and its round black seeds gave you the feeling that they were swarming insects. But after you scraped them off you had the soft pink-red fruit whose belly was serrated and crystalline with sugar. The fruit was soft enough that it fell apart between your tongue and the roof of your mouth and went down like a sweet liquid. There was also an array of pineapple bushes but they were too young to bear fruit, and there was a plantain grove whose trees were like stalks and under whose palm fronds were the green or yellow tooth-like rows of banana fruit. But they were thicker than bananas and tasted like their tart, dry ends until you fried them with a lot of oil and sugar. Then they softened and were filling like meat.</p>
<p>In the forest the leaves covered the ground so thickly that your feet sank into the shin as if you were stepping in snow. When you cleared them away the bottommost leaves were disintegrated, only gray stems and veins like a fish plucked clean, and the soil was black and moist like spent coffee grounds and every fistful of earth flashed and squirmed with insects in your palm. I thought about the island coming out of the ocean as cooling magma, then the first bird dropping seeds on it, and now it was covered with life and deep with it, too. And everything growing out of the remains of everything that died on it. I thought about how it was possible for the island to get more and more life and matter, and I&rsquo;m thinking that it&rsquo;s the work of millions of small birds over the course of hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of years. Seeds in their poop, insects for their young, fish and crabs coming ashore, rain every afternoon, a handful of life arriving every day to the island.</p>
<p>A stout, dark-skinned man named Tony owned the island. One of his calves was heavily scarred, nearly carved out. It was hairless from the scarring, and knotted and shiny like a piece of polished wood. He dragged it behind him. But his eyes were kind, black and glittering like you always had an inside joke with him. He and two brothers were slowly transforming the island into a surfers&rsquo; hostel. I worked for six weeks under another man, an American named Richard, a tan and wiry man of 62 years with a dark hairy chest. Some part of his face or one of his limbs was always twitching, and he was always scowling. So it was five men on that island, including me.</p>
<p>Every morning I got a rice sack from the main sack and went around the island picking fruit and collecting eggs. There were some groceries from the mainland like vegetables, pasta, rice, cooking oil, and spices. We cooked on a two-burner stove that was attached by a hose to a squat propane tank. We cooked with and drank from the rainwater that collected into a blue plastic garbage bin from the rain gutter of the main hut. The water tasted slightly metallic and alkaline. I drank it liberally. The two brothers fished often and would salt the perch and dry it out on the rock wall in front of the hut. The small cubes of rock salt looked tasty on the tan flesh that had in the sun shrunken beneath the spine and rib bones. The brothers spoke a quiet, mumbling Spanish that was inchorent to me and kept to themselves.</p>
<p>The south side of the island had dozens of coconut trees. You could go around picking up coconuts and shaking them to see if they had juice. The glossy green ones sloshed with more juice than the grey-brown ones, but these were sweeter. I got good at that two-part machete strike that would create a wedge into the shell for me to drink its juice. I shook the juice out into a bowl, then I split the shell with an overhead machete strike and carved out the hard white meat with a spoon. Ants swarmed under me and bit my bare feet as juice and slivers of fruit ran down my front, and I would rub my feet over each other to alleviate the sting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To wash I would go into the ocean and rub sand into my skin and hair. The water was warm and shallow, the clear aqua that flashes with sunlight and means paradise. Then I would walk back up the carved stairs up to the hut and rinse the salt off my skin with bowls of rainwater from the blue bin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes I went for a swim in the ocean. You could go far out because on the north side of the island there were no waves. But I wouldn&rsquo;t go too far. The shallowness continues for some time before it drops off suddenly into a cold and hostile world of powdery-gray detritus and narrow brown fish that pick at it, their fins fanning, and dart when your shadow is on them. The sunlight is geometric here and cuts cleanly toward the floor like prisms from the surface, which here are the heavens themselves. At this depth the weight of the ocean presses on you and gives you a sharp pain in your ears, like there&rsquo;s a sliver of glass in your skull. The fear&rsquo;s there too, the prey feeling. Darkens the mind and the edges of your vision, and makes you think there&rsquo;s a shark or a barracuda coming at you in your blind spots.</p>
<p>Tony had me restore the walkway to the frond-thatched hut, to dust and remove detritus from the stone-carved staircase up the cliff. There was a mound of about 100 glass bottles of Panamanian rum in the woods, and he wanted me to plant them bottom-up on the path between the hut and the hostel which was at the time only a two-bedroom stucco frame. The hut and the hostel were about a half-mile apart, which was the length of the island. After soaking them in soapy water I scraped off their labels with steel wool and gouged out the earth with a spade to plant them. Sometimes I took things like a generator or a small refrigerator by wheelbarrow between the hut and the hostel. The men were older than me and got tired quickly. They were digging a well on the east end of the island where the hostel was.</p>
<p>Tony had a boy who had first come onto the island with me. We had picked him up from school and drove through the night to the beach where the skiff was moored. We drove in a pick-up truck with three seats in the front, and the boy whose name wasn&rsquo;t Spanish but something long and indigenous, was sullen with me. Then some time later he decided that he liked me and he would shout my name whenever he arrived on the island. He would strip down to his white underwear and would stay like that until he left the island again He followed Tony or me around and would help me with my chores. There was a battered and flat ball in the hut, and we kicked it around. Sometimes when I walked the edge of the cliff I saw him swimming in the ocean. He showed me with a knife how to peel the green skin off the cane and and bite it with the molars to release the sugar juice and to suck on it until only the stringy pulp remained. He was confident with the knife and the machete that he brought down in one clean motion to cleave the cane off so that it was like an organ pipe, and he smiled as he sucked on his end of the cane. He was good and happy and he loved his father, and I avoided him.</p>
<p>Richard helped me put together a shelter on my first week on the island, on the cliff of one of the northern points of the island. We carried a long bamboo rod to the site where it acted as a tarp pole. He let me borrow his tent, which I patched with duct tape. Richard had plotted out some land on the east side of the island where he was going to build a home. I offered to help him with it. We spent a few hours that day beach combing on the east and west sides of the island, collecting sea glass, uncracked shells, and polished pieces of driftwood. There were sizzling tufts of yellow sea foam and wobbly knobs of jellyfish pierced with sunlight. There were tire shavings, bottles of plastic and polished glass. The glass was dark amber, medicine blue, clear, and frosted, and there were the frayed remains of webbed lawn chairs, shoes, blue netting, aluminum cans, and rusty pieces of metal.</p>
<p>Richard and I met every half-hour to show each other what we had found. We spent most of our time at a distance with our attention at our feet and our eyes attracted toward any strange and man-made colors, shapes, and patterns. He was looking for the other mate of a pair of sandals. I returned all that I found to the sand in a small pile and looked with him. It occurred to me that we wouldn&rsquo;t find pairs of any kind on this beach. But eventually I found an off-brand sandal for him that was the same size. We walked ankle-deep toward a smaller beach that could only be reached in the low tide. He said that everything we needed except for food could be found on the shores of remote islands near America and that we didn&rsquo;t need to make anything anymore, except for food.</p>
<p>On my computer was a video of Alex and me on a beach in Fort Bragg, California. We spent a weekend there at a bed and breakfast after I had worked there during the winter break of my sophomore year. One morning we walked a few miles along the strip of beach between the ocean and the cliffs. There was a long wooden bridge between two cliffs. It lay over a shallow murky lake that carried into the ocean. There was a policeman wading slowly toward something under the bridge. We leaned over the bridge to see what it was. It was a dead man on his back.</p>
<p>The beaches of Northern California are not like the ones in Southern California. They&rsquo;re narrow and above them are wet and rocky cliffs and rock formations you climb down to get to the beaches. On the cliffs are meadows of green grass and wildflowers, and there are also tall, skinny trees that are bedheaded from the cold sea winds and gesture inland. The water is the kind that you only go in to show that you&rsquo;re a man. The waves have bored holes in some of the outcroppings of wet black rock and have made arches and islands. Some of the islands are flat and have fresh grass and wildflowers upon them. At first you think there&rsquo;s also trash on these islands, and you wonder how someone had swam and scaled its walls which are 20 feet high. But then you see a lot of seagulls with red dipped on their yellow beaktips coming back and forth toward the island like it&rsquo;s a beached, dead whale, and you realize that it isn&rsquo;t trash. It&rsquo;s the black and white downy feathers of their young. You want to climb onto the island and lie on the grass because you know that no one else has ever been there. On the beaches are dark green and rubbery sea kelp, hollow yellow-brown bulbs, white driftwood, and the fishy decay of jellyfish and seashells. When the tide ebbs, the water sizzles and bubbles over the sand like the mouth of a crab. The polished pieces of glass and pebbles crunch underfoot such as when you dig your hand into a jar of marbles.</p>
<p>She is running ahead of me, dancing just beyond the last unfoldings of waves along the sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No rules,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;No rules!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>She is wearing a black hoodie with a white zipper, blue jeans, and gray Converse sneakers. She is wearing her black-framed glasses that are big for her face. Her black hair is rich and mane-like and begins at her widow&rsquo;s peak and reaches the middle of her back. I have spent many nights with my nose in its roots. An old pair of leather binoculars from the inn hang from her neck, as they do on mine. They are heavy and cloudy, and we have brought them for show. I am laughing as I record her, thinking about how we will watch this video in the future after we have spent many years away from each other, after we realize that in spite of having met when we were so young, we hadn&rsquo;t yet met anyone like the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re taking advantage of &lsquo;No Rules,&rsquo;&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>Then she comes sideways towards me to avoid the lens. I lower it and we embrace.</p>
<p>What a photo or a video can do is anchor a memory, like a historical fact. It can keep it from wear or corruption. And when you look at it after many years, after the bramble of memory has obscured it, the truth emerges. We should be suspicious of our memories because I read that every act of remembrance alters the memory itself, like a game of telephone. But a memory feeds on remembrance, so either way it&rsquo;s doomed.</p>
<p>That video of Alex on the beach is gone now. Before leaving for my trip I erased it from my computer because I wanted to feel something. I did, I felt a stupid kind of loss. And now she&rsquo;s leaving my head, losing dimension. That makes me kind of sad. But grateful too, that a memory has a half-life, but that the way she made me feel will live as long as I do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a photo from that weekend, too. We&rsquo;re in our room in the old water tower. She&rsquo;s in the Thinker&rsquo;s pose, but she&rsquo;s leaning back in her chair. On the table before her are two fat wine glasses filled with white wine, a harmonica, a basil jar of bush weed I had gotten from Steve, the hotel&rsquo;s maintenance man. One of her arms is across her belly, and her fist is up against her chin. Her bra is black and her underwear is pink. If I were to slip that photo in these pages, right here, so that as you opened to it you saw the defensiveness in her dark eyes and the nonchalance in her limbs, the pale skin of her thighs, then it goes without saying that you would pass over my description in favor of the photo itself. She&rsquo;d come alive to you. I&rsquo;m looking at that photo on my desk right now. Makes me think: Yes, that is what it was like.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>5.</p>
<p>I REMEMBER in high school once when we were working on the newspaper, she came in to deliver some photos of hers. It was a Saturday morning. She had just come back from the beach. She was wearing a spring-green dress, and she glowed in the shy and generous way that a girl does when she considers that she might be beautiful. I looked and looked at her from behind my computer.</p>
<p>I remember she told me that her mom went through depression when she was little. One day her mom&rsquo;s grandmother died and she saw her mom crying by her bed. She went to her and cried with her. She was two then, and her mom told her that story years later when she could understand.</p>
<p>I remember that her dad once told her that he was going to run an errand, and she asked him if she could go along. I'm not sure how old she was. Three, four, five. She ended up looking at an apartment with him, and it wasn&rsquo;t until she was older that she realized how close her parents' marriage was to coming undone.</p>
<p>I know that her sister and her mom used to fight a lot, and I know she doesn&rsquo;t raise her voice to anyone.</p>
<p>I remember the way she was looking at me at that party in the summer after high school. I was drunk for the first time in my life, and only had on my friend&rsquo;s swim trunks which were really big on me. She was looking at me like I was good, like I was what she was looking for. But there was something deeper there, too. It was like she was looking just a little bit beyond me. There was something sad and out-of-focus about her eyes that didn&rsquo;t have to do with me. I didn&rsquo;t know that at the time, but now I do.</p>
<p>I remember when we talked in the summer after we graduated from high school she told me she wished things were different, but she couldn't say why.</p>
<p>One time we went to see a reading of two well-known writers. We drank before, on the way, during, and I loved her that night. When we got there she told me she needed to pee so we both stumbled into the bathroom. I&rsquo;m peeing in front of you, she said, and I supposed she&rsquo;d never done that before and I loved her that night.</p>
<p>We passed that bottle of vodka and juice back and forth as we sat in the back. She always drank better than me. The two writers and the moderator were talking about how their books had really similar themes even though they were super different, and I turned to her and whispered <em>he&rsquo;s just jacking them off</em> and I motioned like I was giving her a handjob and she tilted her head back and groaned throatily and we laughed. She was always quick like that. On our way to the station she said <em>look</em>. She looked around and opened her jacket. She was wearing an oversized bomber jacket over a light green dress, and she whispered <em>remember how I told you I was having problems with my dress</em> and she opened it, not seductively but like a kid to a kid, and her boobs were peering out from over the cups of her dress. Right on the corner of Van Ness and something. I told her that I didn&rsquo;t see what was the problem and pretended to reach for them like a zombie and she laughed.</p>
<p>While we were waiting for the train to take us home I remember that she looked at me in this almost complete adoration. I felt unfit for that look. So I looked away. I asked her how her legs were doing in the cold, one ankle up, en pointe and pestling into the ground like she needed to pee. She said she just being a little jittery and she looked at me again with that look but it was sheepish, too. I realized that she thought I had asked her <em>what are you doing</em> so I said <em>no, I meant how are you doing, it&rsquo;s so cold</em> and she said <em>ohh</em> and her sheepishness went away and she said <em>nuuthing</em> and it was that look again, and I had to look away again.</p>
<p>And I remember the last time I saw her too, couple months after all this. She was home for Christmas, and she hit me up. I was living at my parents&rsquo;, and she picked me up and we talked the whole night. Made love. Hung out again a couple days later. It wasn&rsquo;t the same. I thought it was so strange that you could do the same motions with another person that you did a couple years back when you loved each other, but feel like this time you were with a stranger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I remember when she dropped me off she wouldn&rsquo;t turn her car off. She started to cry silently, and I heard her tears thud on my windbreaker. I asked her in the wrong voice why she was crying. She said it was for those times past that we could never get back, and I went home and hit my desk and also cried. A couple months later I decided to go and see her in Seattle. I hitchhiked there from Big Sur. Got a really bad case of poison oak all over my body trying to bushwhack my way through the overgrown trail, spent the coldest night of my life on the Lost Coast Trail after I fell into a river, and got a ride with a bunch of hippies up to Arcata. Spend a day hitching up to Eugene with an old guy named Jimmy who looked like Fidel Castro. We slept in the stall of a bathroom at a rest stop that night because it was so cold outside. Then it was a straight shot from Portland to Seattle, and I got a bus to her place. We walked around this big green lake by her house. She said that sometimes you could see orcas surface in it. I told her that it was like we lived in different worlds, and she laughed. It was the morning, but we brown-bagged a couple 40s and drank on a park bench. We went with her friends to a bar that night and played pool. I remember her best friend saying, I never know what&rsquo;s really going on with her. Yeah me too, I said. We spent the night on the couch of her friend. My face was on her chest. I asked her if she wanted to get back together, and I closed my eyes. I felt her chest rise and fall. No.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re my favorite, she whispered, and she kissed me around my face. That made me cry. Then she left, before it was even light out, and I never saw her again.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>6.</p>
<p>TOWARD THE END of my stay we went into mainland in the skiff. Richard wanted to catch up with some of his friends. I also knew he wanted to get laid.</p>
<p>His battered green jeep was by the dock. We drove for about a half hour down the coast to his house with cans of beer in our laps. We followed a gravel road through a neighborhood of large houses, most of which he said belonged to American expatriates. Richard told me how the owners of these homes had made their money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This guy started breeding, like, short, squat coconut trees so you can pick the nuts easier. Rolling in it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hotels, man. Resorts all up and down the coast. Chiriqui, Boca Negra and shit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We passed by a panader&iacute;a, whose owner stared at Richard as we drove by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She and I had a long conversation in the hopes of reconciliation,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And we came to the conclusion that she was a sour cunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We pulled into his driveway. Richard was three beers in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s light stuff,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Literally cannot fuck you up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His small two-room house had bats. They fluttered like jagged pieces of black cloth that changed in size as they moved from rafter to rafter. They blocked the light and put shadows on the wall. His home had the earthy and urine-like odor of bat feces, and the linens on the bed he let me sleep on were dusted with it. His bathroom had black mold in the corners. The toilet seat had a broken hinge and was yellowed and peeling, and the hole in the wall of the shower was plugged with a green soda bottle that let in a fractured green light. What appeared to be soil, but what I later realized were the feces, was scattered on the concrete floor. Molding dishes covered in these feces filled his sink, all of his kitchen&rsquo;s countertops, and the floor around. I spent a few hours cleaning his kitchen while Richard visited his friends. My pruny hands glowed with heat from the harsh soap. After I finished I walked around the neighborhood hoping to find a pick-up game of soccer. But there was nothing going on, and I spent a few hours walking along the beach sand which was soft with yellow palm fronds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I went to bed I put on a long-sleeved shirt and pants within my sleeping bag and slept with my hood on in fear that I would be bitten by a bat.</p>
<p>Around midnight he persuaded me to come with him to the local bar on the beach. I came, though I knew he only wanted me to so I help him get a girl. He was already drunk, and he wanted to drive there. I told him I would walk there myself. He drove into a ditch just ahead of me. We walked together. There were a few local men at the bar. They were grinning at the two women there. They crooned to the music and shuffled their feet. Richard brought me over to the younger of the women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;El es muy inteligente,&rdquo; he shouted over the music.</p>
<p>She smiled politely at me.</p>
<p>I left and went to bed.</p>
<p>Hours later I heard the front door open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brian!&rsquo; Richard shouted. &ldquo;We have guests!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ignored him and went back to sleep with earplugs.</p>
<p>In the morning there was broken glass on his porch. The outdoor table was shattered, and there was blood smeared on the ground. Richard was smoking on a chair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a long drag and flicked the butt onto the grass. &ldquo;Brought back some friends from the bar, guy and a girl. Girl would only come on condition that the guy would, so fuck it, we all came back here. You were knocked out. Go back to my room and start up a porno in my bed. Missionary, doggy shit. Nothing fucked up. Everything&rsquo;s going swell until the man starts groping the woman. Grabbing her tits, pinching her ass, pulling her hair. &lsquo;<em>Puta, Puta.&rsquo;</em> So I grab the fucker by the seat of his pants and drag him outside. Put his face through the glass table and stomp on his head a couple times to put some sense in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he now?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Took off like a bitch. Left some teeth, too. Man. Mood dead, girl gone. Didn&rsquo;t even get to fuck her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he asked me for help in jacking his car out of the ditch, I told him that since he had gotten himself into that ditch, he should be the one to get himself out of it. He stared at me. Then he quietly resumed his work.</p>
<p>I read on his porch for a bit then left to visit Richard&rsquo;s friend, Chuck, a Texan expatriate, to see if I could use his internet connection. When I returned to Richard&rsquo;s after the sun had gone down I found that the front door was locked. So I set up camp on his porch and waited for him to come. When he did late into the night I greeted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cocksucker,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You think you can just leave, like just fucking get up and go&mdash;well, what the fuck am I supposed to do&mdash;am I just supposed to carry on with my fucking day? I hired you to work for me, motherfucker, you're mine, you're supposed to be at my every beck and call, you coddled piece of shit, you probably had your mom make your bed for you every morning, you freeloading motherfucker. You never worked a goddamn day in your life, you fucking kid, you selfish fuck, you're only thinking about yourself, that's all you ever fucking do&mdash;how do I promote myself, how do I manipulate people to like me&mdash;you'll be successful but you'll be so fucking alone because no one wants to be around selfish pricks like you and you think you're so fucking smart but guess what, motherfucker&mdash;<em>I'm smarter than you</em>&mdash;I've been around for forty fucking years longer than you and you're a dumb motherfucker. You didn&rsquo;t even know what the fuck was going when we almost died on that boat! I saw you, you fucking fool, you were out of your fucking head on that boat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Your parents fucked up, your brother and your sister fucked up, and there's no fucking hope for you. If my kids ever acted like you I'd beat them into the fucking ground. At three, at three fucking years of age, my son and my daughter fucking outshined you, you disrespectful piece of shit. Don't you fucking judge me&mdash;yeah I know you fucking judge me, the way you look at me and the way you use your goddamn <em>tone</em> with me, I see you writing in your little fucking diary about me, you think I'm fucking a&mdash;a <em>drunk</em> and a <em>loser</em>&mdash;well you're a goddamn sociopath. You just stand there, you remorseless fucker&mdash;is anything I'm saying even reaching you? What did I do to you to make you hate me? Well, fuck you. <em>Fuck you</em>. You're never coming back to the island&mdash;all your stuff's gone, that shelter&rsquo;s <em>mine</em> now&mdash;because I don't want you manipulating anyone, I don't want you near the clients 'cus you'll just manipulate your way into getting them to do whatever you want. I don't ever want to see you again. Ciao! <em>Ciao!&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>We went back to the island the next day. Richard answered to Tony who had no problems with me. For the next three days I lived in a hell. On the skiff ride to the island Richard told me he would kill me if I tried to &ldquo;fuck with Tony or with him.&rdquo; I asked him if he was serious. Yeah, you dumb motherfucker. I worked as I normally did in the daytime, but I also sharpened a long branch into a spear and kept it by my new shelter, which I made in the forest on the island&rsquo;s west side. I carried a few rocks in my pocket. I did push-ups, dips, sit-ups, and chin-ups off tree branches. At night under a leaking rain fly I had found in the hut, drops of water thudded on my forehead and mosquitoes for my skin, and I listened for him to come. If I have to kill him, I thought, I&rsquo;ll kill him.</p>
<p>The morning we left I went into his bag and among empty prescription bottles of lithium I found his passport. I was going to bury it or throw it off the island, but I decided not to. Instead I went into his journal, in which was written:</p>
<p>Locate saw near plot.</p>
<p>Begin staking land out.</p>
<p>Help Brian with shelter.</p>
<p>In his penmanship I wrote sporadically throughout the journal:</p>
<p>Where is my family?</p>
<p>Where are my friends?</p>
<p>Am I alone?</p>
<p>Where has my memory gone?</p>
<p>I am going to die alone, and no one will know that I did.</p>
<p>Out of lithium &hellip; think I&rsquo;m going crazy &hellip;</p>
<p>Then I went to the shelter on the cliff over the sea. I was going to rip apart his tarp and his tent with a knife, but I didn&rsquo;t. I only threw the bamboo rod off the cliff. The tide was up to the steps on the cliff. The waves were foamy and yellow-gray. Tony kayaked to the anchored skiff to bring it closer to shore. He hovered it as closely as he could without scraping the rudder on the sand. Richard and I waded out toward them with our backpacks above our heads. We climbed with our elbows over the side of the boat. We motored a few miles over the sea toward the small bay. The low green trees grew up to the shore and the lake-waves lapped at their roots and trunks. Tony slowed the skiff when we entered an inlet. We hummed through the still water for a few more minutes. When we were close to the small beach that opened just a few feet to the road Tony killed the motor and motioned to me with the mooring line. We continued to move slowly toward the shore. I took off my shirt and my sandals and slid into the dark green water and swam with my head dry toward the beach. I felt with my toes a cold black current. I tasted my wet lips. It was freshwater. The boy dove in behind me with a shout. I hitched the line to the thick trunk of a tree whose branches hung over the water and began slowly to pull the boat toward me. The boy climbed the tree with his foot on the rope and leaped off it. He swam in the shadow of the tree and spat water out of his mouth. I wanted to tell him that this was the last time I would see him. Instead I walked up the gravel beach onto the road and began south. Some rain had come, and the asphalt was moist and crunchy and had the bitter scent of wet soil. I had with me four big avocados from the good tree. They were dark and firm and gave like clay when you pressed into them. The air was new and cool, and I felt that brief virtue as you do when you begin on the road again after a long time. Then it was a matter of waiting. I spent a night in a large concrete pipe outside of a strip mall. It was a good place to sleep because one end was blocked by a perpendicular pipe. I lit a citronella candle to ward off mosquitoes. The light was alive on the walls of the pipe like fire on the wall of a cave. The next day I found a wooden shed. It rained hard that night. Then I hitchhiked to a hostel on the Atlantic side of Panama to see if I could work there. The owner was an old American. He told me he didn&rsquo;t need anyone. The girl who worked there gave me some sheets and told me to take one of the bunks in the hostel. She was pretty and had big brown eyes. At night the old American shined his light in my direction and held it there for some time while he and the girl whispered. I kept my eyes closed. In the morning before anyone woke I went back to Panama City. The young black man who gave me a ride there said I could sleep at his home. When we got there at night he went inside to talk to his mother. He said I could sleep outside their apartment. Then at the airport terminal I found some earbuds on the seat next to me. I went to the bathroom, sat on the toilet and listened to a song and cried.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>7.</p>
<p>THERE WAS A GIRL coming toward me. She must have been there to check out the blackout, too. She was cute, with brown hair that came down to her shoulders. Her hair looked really soft and healthy. It kind of reminded me of that haircut girls had during the World Wars, English or French girls with berets and stockings and satchels running during an air raid. She was dressed in a nice way, too. Just a black t-shirt and tight black jeans that fit real well, and some red lipstick. She had a watch that was facing the other way. She had great legs and a great butt, too, and she knew it, because her t-shirt was tucked in. I like girls who like clothes, but I don&rsquo;t like girls where clothes and looking good is their life. Just something simple and classic. Too much production and you&rsquo;re worried she&rsquo;ll wilt throughout the day and be a meaner version of herself when she&rsquo;s not made up. This girl looked like the kind who would know a lot about a certain kind of art, like photography or film. You could tell by her eyes, the way they were swimming, that they were looking for the best in you, and that she wouldn&rsquo;t think lesser of you if you didn&rsquo;t have a particular opinion on Godard or something. Like she was into art because it made her feel good, not because it made her look good.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s coming my way and we both look at each other longer than usual because we know we got something in common. The way she looks at me, it&rsquo;s with those kind of wide eyes where you know a girl is interested in you. I was probably giving her the same look, too, because she blushed a little, you know like when someone looks at your eyes for too long and you lose your composure. We both slowed down near each other, and I don&rsquo;t know why but I just kept walking past her, even though we&rsquo;d just pretty much just said that we were into each other. Moments like that, man, they hit you, they shake you. But I&rsquo;ll tell you the reason I didn&rsquo;t make a move, and that&rsquo;s because a couple weeks ago I was at this party. It was Eric&rsquo;s party. He was living at this new house with some cool people who were into the cutting edge of new music, you know, the kind of people who have religious experiences listening to rock albums and know all about the gossip in the music world. They even had a name for their house, Carleton House, because that was the name of the street they were on. Anyway, first night I went over to them with a handle of rum, and I was my good self. Making good jokes, making people happy, not being excessive. That&rsquo;s my problem: I make a good first impression. It&rsquo;s the second and third where I always mess it up by going too far. For now, these guys were cool with me. One of them even told me that I had a &ldquo;good handle over my drunk self.&rdquo; But they were smart, too, of course. One of them was working with Stephen Hawking or something before he died. Anyway, they had this one friend with them named Marisa. Man, prettiest girl I&rsquo;ve ever seen at Cal. So pretty that I already knew her face before I met her. I always thought it was a good day when I saw her around on campus. Half-Asian, kind of girl whose face you wouldn&rsquo;t change a thing about. Everyone&rsquo;s got a type, and she was it. And cool, too. She always looked like she had something important to do. Anyway, they had this party one night, and I saw her in the kitchen. We got to talking. I don&rsquo;t even remember what we talked about except that it was all jokes, nothing serious, and everything was hitting. Man, you know that feeling when you&rsquo;re buzzed and talking to a great girl and making her laugh? Man, that was that night. I remember she even said during our conversation: &ldquo;Hey, I like you!&rdquo; Not in a romantic way, but that I was <em>in</em>.</p>
<p>But then this black guy came into the conversation, says hi and introduces himself. Marissa asks him where&rsquo;s he from. Brooklyn, he says. Then she gets all shy like he&rsquo;s just said he&rsquo;s Tom Cruise, and she asks him if he doesn&rsquo;t mind her asking him about Brooklyn. The guy grins at me and they start a Q&amp;A about his damn city. This guy, man, he went to Harvard and was going to start law school at Boalt. I also knew that he was 30. So all the while he&rsquo;s giving us this talk I&rsquo;m thinking: this 30-year-old bastard, coming in and poaching at a college party. So I drank some more, figured the night wasn&rsquo;t a total loss, and Eric walked me home.</p>
<p>Couple weeks later those guys had a Fourth of July party. It was just after Germany beat Brazil 7-1 in the World Cup semifinal, and I was walking back from Pappy&rsquo;s to their place on Telegraph. That&rsquo;s when I saw Marissa again, wearing red, white, and blue. I was thinking that today I was going to make my move. But I never really got the chance because I was being a coward. Instead what I was doing was looking at her every chance I got. I knew the way I was looking at her. Maybe you&rsquo;ve seen girls look at you like that, too, like how they could give up everything and go live in your world, how you could save them till they died. She&rsquo;d look at me, too, and look away. Couple days later I was asking about her to Eric.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She thinks you&rsquo;re kinda creepy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Damn, I thought. Damn.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what was in my head when I walked past that girl. But then I thought: That was a connection, wasn&rsquo;t it? It was. So I started running back to where that girl was. Running past VLSB and down onto that intersection on Oxford. Gone. Things like that, those missed connections, they haunt you for life. I turned back and started walking back up campus. All I could think about were her eyes and her ass and how they could save me.</p>
<p>Man, I was thinking about how there was no going back to just talking to a girl and not thinking about how she&rsquo;d look on your arm. It was either yes or no and if it was yes than you got to start playing the game, and if no then you didn&rsquo;t want to be around her. I&rsquo;m thinking your friend&rsquo;s dad was right when he said don&rsquo;t get to fifty because then you can&rsquo;t fall in love anymore. I&rsquo;m thinking there&rsquo;s a reason you and I would rather have daughters than sons, why in the movies you always got the cold-blooded guy who&rsquo;s killed a lot of people and drinks a lot, and then a little girl comes his way, and he ends up loving her and protecting her with his life. He always dies in the end because there&rsquo;s no going back for him, no way he can unsee and undo everything. But the little girl, he can see that she&rsquo;s still pure and good, and he&rsquo;ll do anything to make sure she stays that way. I guess being boys, you know that getting messed up is inevitable, because I&rsquo;m telling you, sometimes I feel like a slave to it. Man, if someone told me he could take it away for good, I might just do it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m saying that if you get a kid, boy or girl, you got to take them away from the city and go to the mountains where there&rsquo;s no internet. I&rsquo;m serious. Make sure they don&rsquo;t forget their definitions. I guess the most important thing is don&rsquo;t have kids unless you have the right definitions, unless you love life. Be there for your kid, man, don&rsquo;t leave him all burnt in the sun, and don&rsquo;t say that you did all you could&mdash;if the kid&rsquo;s alive then it&rsquo;s not too late&mdash;and don&rsquo;t make him hate his life so bad that he kills himself. Don&rsquo;t leave your wife either&mdash;that promise is for life, not a couple years. Don&rsquo;t leave her to kill herself, and don&rsquo;t say that bullshit that you did your part and the rest is on her now. Anyway, raise your kid to be a giver, not a taker. City&rsquo;s a dangerous place to be because everyone&rsquo;s got the same wrong definitions&mdash;you can just tell by the way they look you up and down, thinking about if you&rsquo;re better or they are. That&rsquo;s the pastime of city people, evaluating people, feeling smug if they&rsquo;re above you and anxious if they&rsquo;re below. Lot of fear. No one&rsquo;s got the right eyes in the city&mdash; you know those glittery eyes you see in children and dogs? Those shiny smiling eyes, man, that mean you&rsquo;re full of love. In the city people make their eyes cold&mdash;I figure they&rsquo;re protecting themselves from being hurt. And don&rsquo;t send your kid to a goddamn school either&mdash;you&rsquo;d trust some stranger to have better definitions than you? Man, school&rsquo;s where a kid goes to die. I bet most of the teachers you had were people who were doing the minimum of what they could do without getting fired. I had this one teacher named Mr. Fleming. Had him for 10th grade English. We didn&rsquo;t learn a goddamn thing that whole year. We just dicked around. This one time my friend Michael was sitting in the front row with his Gameboy playing Pokemon with the sound on. Fleming&rsquo;s talking, and Michael&rsquo;s going click, click, click. Finally he goes, Michael, please. Michael says, I have to beat this boss, Mr. Fleming, it&rsquo;s really important. Fleming sighs and says, Okay, just turn off the volume. Another time we tried to order a pizza to our classroom, like my friend Nate was calling the pizza guy on his phone, saying, you know, yeah four pepperoni, four meatlovers, two dozen wings. In the end, Fleming vetoed the whole thing, and we grumbled the whole week. Man, at the time I thought I&rsquo;d lucked out getting him because I didn&rsquo;t have to do shit to get an A in his class. But looking back, man, that guy was committing a real crime. You got a whole year to show kids why you think reading books is important, and you don&rsquo;t. Four English teachers in four years, and only one of them gave half a shit. The rest dicked us around.</p>
<p>I want to tell you about Aashik&rsquo;s grandpa who died pretty recently. Aashik and his family went to the funeral, I think it was in South India, Bangalore, where he was from. He says he was really shocked by how many people came to pay their respects. Thousands of people, from all over. Even an MP came in his helicopter with a bunch of bodyguards. I asked him what the hell his grandpa did. I was thinking he was a big shot businessman or something. Aashik said he was just the guy in his village that everyone would go to talk to when they needed advice. He was from a low caste, too. But he helped a lot of people out, including that MP before he was an MP. The way Aashik was talking about all the people there he had this really faraway look in his eyes. You could tell he was really proud of his grandpa and I bet he was thinking about how he wanted to be like him too someday. Man, someone like him that you could just go and talk to? Wise man of the village? A shepard, man, a catcher.</p>
<p>Another thing I want to tell you about Aashik. Sometimes at night I&rsquo;d see him kneeling on his bed. His eyes would be closed and his hands would be clasped in his lap, praying. I asked him once what he prayed about. He said he prayed for the people in his life and for me, too, that I&rsquo;d find my way soon. I told myself I&rsquo;d do whatever I could to keep the guy as my friend.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>8.</p>
<p>&ldquo;YOU CAN&rsquo;T BE HERE,&rdquo; says a guy with a flashlight. He&rsquo;s wearing one of those campus security uniforms. We&rsquo;re by Haas, the business school that got remodeled to look like a fancy apartment complex. I nod at him and point up toward Gayley, toward the stadium. I continued that way till I was walking past Unit 2 when I thought about going into the courtyard. I don&rsquo;t know how well you remember it, but we were in Davidson, floor six. If you&rsquo;re coming out of Davidson, on your right you&rsquo;ll see a building called Towle, and that&rsquo;s for kids who transferred from a junior college. I went to the glass door that leads to the mailroom and stood there, between two trees, right on the intersection of these four concrete squares. Then I looked up. Reason was, freshman year a kid named Henry Treadway unscrewed the window of his dorm room so that it could open all the way. Then he jumped out and landed right where I was standing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s the spot because the next day all the yellow tape was gone, and there was a Hispanic lady mopping up right there. She had her back to me, and I was trying to get a look at the spot to see if there was any blood there. But she was pretty much finished. She saw me in the glass door. Her eyes got big and she turned around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your friend?&rdquo; She whispered.</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>She nodded and stood there for a couple seconds. Then she got back to mopping.</p>
<p>I was thinking it would have been nice of her to leave some blood on the concrete.</p>
<p>Couple weeks ago I asked my friend if she remembered the kid who killed himself our freshman year. She&rsquo;d lived in Ehrman which is across from Davidson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, didn&rsquo;t he do it because he didn&rsquo;t get into Haas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Man, it&rsquo;s like my brother who told me in this conspiratorial whisper that Anthony Bourdain killed himself because working as a chef was too stressful. They don&rsquo;t get it. They don&rsquo;t get that it isn&rsquo;t one thing, it&rsquo;s everything.</p>
<p>I remember seeing Henry almost every night before he killed himself. He was always smoking on one of those benches by the bike cage. I was seeing a girl named Kari at the time who lived in Ehrman, so we were always walking back and forth across the courtyard. That&rsquo;s the image that comes when I think about Henry, the flame of his lighter making his face glow red. He always gave me these eyes. Not nice eyes, something bad in them. Like he knew something about me that Kari didn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t like being cute with Kari around him because he&rsquo;d always give me those eyes with a half-smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's our friend, Camus,&rdquo; I always said to her when we saw him. I remember making jokes to her that he was going to buy a gun and go berserk one day.</p>
<p>The night he jumped, Alan, Emmylou, and I went for a walk to smoke a joint. When we got back there was an ambulance and yellow tape all over the entrance to Towle.</p>
<p>Man, imagine working hard to get into Cal as a transfer. Maybe he messed around in high school and had to go to community college. Then he got accepted here, and his mom was saying that they always knew he was the brainiac in the family, and in their minds the rest of his life just unrolled before him&mdash;major in philosophy, get into law school, etc&mdash;but it&rsquo;s not that simple. One night he goes to the benches by the bike cage for his smoke. He sees that one dumb Asian guy dicking around with his friends, then maybe he goes back to his room that he has to share with kids who don't get it, a room that he's taken out a big loan to pay for because it costs him two grand a month to share it with another grown man who talks to his long-distance girlfriend every night under his sheets. Sits there for a while. Then he jumps, man, right from the fourth floor&mdash;he sees the ground come at him way too quickly, maybe a bark leaps from his throat, and he lands on his neck and lies there broken, all his joints pointing the wrong way like a goddamn Picasso. What's he thinking about? Hold on, he thinks, hold on, I'm having some new thoughts, and I need more time ...</p>
<p>You know it only takes you four seconds to fall from the Golden Gate? 245 feet, 75 miles per hour. Four-story buildings are only, what, forty feet? I don't know the math, but I don't think that's a lot of time to think or a lot of height to reach a fast speed. You know some people don't die instantly when they hit the water? They drown or die of hypothermia. Man. I&rsquo;m guessing they&rsquo;re feeling strong when they&rsquo;re flying at the water, going faster than a car on the freeway. They&rsquo;re probably willing themselves to go faster, faster. Probably can&rsquo;t hear a thing. Finally it&rsquo;ll all be over, they&rsquo;re thinking. The black water&rsquo;s getting closer and closer&mdash;1, 2, 3, 4&mdash;<em>Blam</em>. But it&rsquo;s not over. They&rsquo;re in the water now&mdash;bones shattered and skin shredded&mdash;in the coldest water they&rsquo;ve ever been in. They probably plummet deep, deep into the ocean, and they can't paddle up to the surface because they&rsquo;re broken, so they&rsquo;re just floating. I'm guessing they got a minute. Man, that&rsquo;s a dark minute. I heard that a lot of people change their minds when they're dying from suicide, like from pills. I figure it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;ve never been in that kind of situation before and it gives them new eyes. Emmylou told me that she heard Henry didn't die right away, that he was lying there gurgling and wheezing like he got the wind knocked out of him, which I guess he probably did. Oh man, I hope Henry didn't change his mind about wanting to die as he lay there all mangled on the cement. I hope he wanted it, right till the end.</p>
<p>I have a friend named Ben Moon. Second of four brothers, all of whom won the IQ jackpot. All of them went to Ivy League schools, youngest brother&rsquo;s in high school now, but he's probably going that way, too. Anyway, the third son, Bernard, he was a senior in high school when he died. You could tell by his friends at his memorial that he was cool. Good-looking friends who looked like they&rsquo;d be athletic and popular. I remember his dad saying he had narrowed down his choices to Cal and Brown but was leaning toward Brown. Ben played a song Bernard had made. It was a hokey song, with synth violins. Knowing Ben, who showed me all this good music, he knew it was hokey, but he still played it. And it was moving, because the kid was dead now.</p>
<p>Ben Moon&rsquo;s the kind of guy you&rsquo;re almost afraid of because of how smart he is. It&rsquo;s humbling to talk to him about something because you know he probably knows more about the thing than you do. I don&rsquo;t how many times I&rsquo;ve been burned by trying to sound smart about something and finding out that he&rsquo;s gone a lot further in that thing than I have. In high school once I was showing him my music collection and showing him that I only downloaded in the highest quality. He smiles a little and asks me if I&rsquo;ve ever heard of FLAC or WAV, and then he showed me this one website where you could download albums in those formats. The website was pretty exclusive&mdash;a member had to invite you or you had to pass an interview with one of the moderators. In the interview you got asked a bunch of questions about things like bitrate and ripping and a lot of other stuff I still don&rsquo;t know about. I asked him how he got in and he said passed the interview. Then he sent me an invite, even though I said it&rsquo;d be wasted on me.</p>
<p>Another time I was over at Ben&rsquo;s house and everyone was playing video games. I was never good at video games so I was just listening to some music with this really nice pair of headphones he had. I must have fallen asleep at some point, but I remember Ben putting a blanket over me. What I want to say is that he's stupid smart, but he&rsquo;s a real guy, too.</p>
<p>At his brother&rsquo;s memorial the oldest brother whose name is Brian got up and told a story about how this one time Bernard was on the phone with his girlfriend in his room. Brian and Ben were back from college so the whole family was there. Brian had this idea of the three brothers sneaking up on Bernard and scaring the shit out of him. They crawled along his carpet to his bed and they had this signal where they all jumped on him at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know he was capable of screaming like that,&rdquo; Brian said, and everyone laughed. I looked over at his girlfriend. She was biting her lip and looking down. I was thinking about all the brothers messing around like that and now one of them dead, and I damn near cried in my seat, too.</p>
<p>How Bernard died from what I heard was that he was with his friends at an elementary school. They were doing something for the science fair, and they had, I think, propane gas canisters like the ones you use for camping, and also a skateboard. They were trying to propel the skateboards with them or something. I don't know exactly. It was probably a lot smarter than it sounds, you know, like they probably weren't stabbing the canisters with a screwdriver and putting a match to the leak. Anyway, one of them exploded in his face and he bled to death. Man, one minute you're joking around with your friends&mdash;it's the end of senior year, you got a cute smart girlfriend, you got a car, and in a couple months you're going to beautiful Brown where Ben went&mdash;then suddenly there&rsquo;s a bang and a flash and your vision's getting dimmer, there's this warm soup all over your neck, and you&rsquo;re wondering why your friends are looking at you in a way they never have and why you suddenly feel real tired, and you think it might be good to close your eyes for a minute. Well, that&rsquo;s that, you think.</p>
<p>I was thinking about how his mom was probably at home when she got the call. Maybe she was getting ready for bed, and she'd told Bernard to come home before midnight. She and her husband were glad he'd come out like his older brothers, no smoking, no drinking, just science fair stuff. Then she gets a call from the hospital. Been an accident, come as soon as possible. Man, she knows. Because they&rsquo;d tell her if he was going to be alright. She's in a dream when they take her downstairs. She knows they only take corpses downstairs. Then there's a gurney with a white sheet over it and she pulls it back.</p>
<p>That elementary school was closed the next day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That spot,&rdquo; the kids would say when they got back to school, &ldquo;a kid died there. Right there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gas tank exploded in his face. Like a grenade. The shrapnel cut his jugular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother said that if you cut your jugular you automatically bleed to death. Even a paper cut, you'll bleed to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look how the concrete's darker. That's blood, that's his blood.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can't wash blood out, my brother said it's only thing you can't wash out.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard there wasn't any blood in his body by the time they got him into the ambulance. He was flat, like he got run over or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know he went here, a long time ago? Ms. Corlew remembers him. She said he was really smart, a real genius, all the brothers were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bernard died right there, like the intersection of the concrete squares where Henry landed. I think it would be good to put an engraving on the spots where people have died, just a little symbol or an initial and a 1993-2015 or something. Then when you're walking around all caught up in your thoughts, you might see one and it'd make you think for a bit. They do that when someone dies in a car or bike accident. They'll paint a bike white and chain it to a pole near where the person got hit or they'll make a mini Catholic shrine. You see them a lot when you're driving bendy mountain roads. There'll be flowers and little trinkets with a photo of the dead person. Usually, it's a Hispanic person, and usually they're young. A young kid like Bernard, why take him? What were all his brains for, all the tennis lessons and the college applications and everything if he was just going to be taken away like that?</p>
<p>My mom told me that when she was little her older sister died in her sleep of carbon monoxide poisoning. A few days earlier my mom had slept over at her sister&rsquo;s house, who was married. She told her sister she should get her pipes looked at because a couple times in the middle of the night she had woken up gasping. Couple days later her sister died in her sleep. I remember my mom told me this while I was walking past her in the living room. I stopped to listen to her and she began to cry. She said it could have been her who died. She asked me if I thought God would have sent her to hell. She said she didn&rsquo;t think so, that it didn&rsquo;t matter who she was or what she had or hadn&rsquo;t done because she was so young. I thought of my mom as a child, youngest of seven, wide-eyed in mortal fear as she stood at the doorway to the bedroom where her sister lay. The whole family huddled in there quiet and crying. I thought of her sister, who seemed eternally young in my mind and who must have looked like my mother when she was young.</p>
<p>My mother&rsquo;s parents owned an undergarments shop and put their kids to work. Someone they knew told her parents that her older brother had a brain and should go to school. He had wanted to go, too. &ldquo;When can I go to school?&rdquo; He asked his dad. But he didn&rsquo;t let him. Instead he had him deliver undergarments by bicycle every morning. One winter he got a bad cough and died.</p>
<p>I walked back home from Unit 2 along Dwight and past People&rsquo;s Park. It&rsquo;s grim walking by that park at night. You think about how it might have been in the past, with all these fresh kids with big glasses and high-waisted pants protesting for free speech or civil rights, and now you&rsquo;ll hardly see a student there, just homeless people with their shopping carts and blue tarps setting up camp for the night. Black garbage bags split open and ragged clothes all over the sidewalk, those cardboard takeout boxes with rotting food all mashed and thrown around. Sometimes needles. People howling, people laughing and talking to themselves. You&rsquo;ll hardly see a girl walking by that park at night, and if you do she&rsquo;ll practically run by it.</p>
<p>Nowadays there aren&rsquo;t too many tress in that park, just stumps. I&rsquo;m guessing they&rsquo;d been cut down pretty recently because there were a lot of cockroaches sniffing and feeling around. That&rsquo;s what happens when you chop down a lot of trees. All the roaches that lived in them get displaced so you see them roaming around. There was one right by my foot, waving its feelers at my toe. I bent down to get a good look at the guy. Some people really hate the things, but they don&rsquo;t give me the same reaction that those big jungle centipedes and the potato bugs with their fat yellow legs do. Like scarab beetles, they look like very fine machines to me. There&rsquo;s something analytical, thoughtful even, about the way they move their feelers, and the way they&rsquo;ll respond to your movements. Even their heads look like they&rsquo;ve been clicked into place, and that they&rsquo;d spark and be a mess of chips and wires if you stepped on one of them. I did my best to avoid that, though, all the way down Dwight till I got back onto Telegraph. Aashik and Axel&rsquo;s apartment was right where Berkeley turns into Oakland, where Telegraph starts to die.</p>
<p>All the way back I was imagining my mom&rsquo;s dead brother going to school for the first time. I bet he&rsquo;d have a couple new pencils and some new clothes even, or maybe just some hand-me-downs that his mom washed and ironed for him the night before. Thought about him sitting up straight at his desk before school starts while all the other kids are running around. There&rsquo;s a freshly sharpened pencil lined up on his desk, and he loves that thing. He keeps pushing the sharpened tip into his index finger and promises himself that he&rsquo;s never going to use that pristine pink eraser. Promises himself that he&rsquo;s going to work as hard as he can because it sure beat riding his bike every morning. And me, man, throwing it all away without even telling my parents to try to prove something that didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>9.</p>
<p>WE WENT OUT to San Francisco that night, Polk Street. I always have these expectations for bars, and then you go to them and no one even talks to anyone outside their group, at least in the cities. Then even within your group all people want to talk about is food, like it's the damn Pieta. That's all they got is food. It's the best samosa I&rsquo;ve ever had, they'll say. Literally heaven in my mouth. You have to try it. Eating, man, it's the highest art. You <em>have</em> to go to Singapore and eat the satay there. You think a Michelin-star satay would have stopped Henry from jumping? Dangle that shit out the window and tell him to come off the ledge?&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a girl with us who was one of Aashik&rsquo;s friends from class. She was interested in me from the beginning of the night, and I figured I could use it. We went from bar to bar, and when I went outside for some air she followed me out and was familiar with me like we&rsquo;d been going out for a while. She had a big chest and she kept pressing it against my chest. She was like a little girl with her high voice. Then after some drinks we went over the bridge back to her apartment and after some wine we went to her bed and when I finished the air was metallic and after I washed I left her apartment and walked out down a hill back home. Felt like I needed to have a real human moment so I hit up a girl named Natalie who I knew was having a birthday party at her pre-med frat. I went over and headed right for the liquor. I was already messed up but you can always use some more when you&rsquo;re at a new place. There were still a lot of people at the party, but it was that part of the night where drinking more just makes you dead in the eyes. I go sit across from these two girls on a couch. We were talking a little. The older one was an alumna, she was at real med school now, at Harvard. Damn, <em>Har</em>vard, I kept saying, and they laughed at that. The younger one was a freshman, cute delicate girl. She wasn&rsquo;t drinking, and she was being shy. I poured shots and pushed them toward them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then this guy comes up to me, and goes: They&rsquo;ve had enough. The guy is pissed. I tell him to sit down and have a drink with us. What&rsquo;s your name, man? Elliott. The guy won&rsquo;t move. His fists are clenched, he&rsquo;s breathing slowly, looks like he wants to murder me. He&rsquo;s having a real moment, like all his life he&rsquo;s wanted to have one brave moment, and he sees me and goes for it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calm down,&rdquo; I tell him. &ldquo;Have a drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s had enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing he&rsquo;s talking about the freshman, because the older girl just looks amused. The freshman girl whose name is Sara looks like she wants to disappear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look man,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you let your friend decide for herself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guy doesn&rsquo;t say anything, just stands right in front of me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just trying to have a drink with your friends, man. I&rsquo;m not trying to rape them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;By now, there are a couple of his friends leering over at us. Man, when I said that, I might as well have said that I <em>was</em> trying to rape them. They got all excited, all primal, like I was the goddamn devil, man, and I was wondering if they could <em>smell</em> it on me. Then one of them, big guy, came up to me and asked me who I knew here.</p>
<p>I just wanted to show them I wasn&rsquo;t a bad guy so I turned to Elliott and asked him if he wanted to go outside to talk it out. I just wanted to make a goddamn real connection, man, just have a real goddamn human moment. But everyone there thought I was saying that I wanted to fight the guy, and finally Natalie told me it&rsquo;d be best if I left. She talked to me outside for a minute, telling me that Elliott and Sara went way back to when they were kids, had grown up together and all that. Well, how the hell was I supposed to know that I was playing an extra in their goddamn Korean drama? But I was so messed up that I just told her <em>okay, okay I get it</em>. I decided to run back home, as fast as I could, falling over a couple times. Couple miles later I entered the apartment. I couldn&rsquo;t breathe, felt like someone was squeezing my brain. My heart was going real fast, man, thought I was having a heart attack, and I was spiralling real bad, trying to bottom out by telling myself things that I was sure about, trying to find some footing. I was a freak, man, I knew it, and so did everyone else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh man,&rdquo; I whispered as I walked around the apartment. &ldquo;Oh man, oh man, oh man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll take a bath, I thought. A hot bath will help me.</p>
<p>Took off my clothes and ran the hot water. Put my mouth underwater and screamed. I was panicking real bad, man. Everything was coming up now. Man, I wanted to kill my dad for doing what he did to me. Man, I wanted to kill him, and I wanted to kill my brother, too. I put my mouth to the faucet and coughed as it came into my lungs. I thrust my head underwater. My forehead struck the tub floor. The water fell over my head and rumbled around me. I put my hands over my ears and started yanking at my hair. Man, nothing was ever going to change for me. Again and again, I thought. Day after day, night after night, year after year. Back on that island one day we tried to take the skiff to mainland. It was raining, and then it became a storm. We were all turned around, and we were running out of gas. Richard was going, &ldquo;Damn, had to be the ocean, huh?&rdquo; But I figured it wasn&rsquo;t a bad way to go, and I closed my eyes. Then everyone laughed and clapped me on the back. The island had appeared before us as a dark forested mound.</p>
<p>Man, sitting in that tub I was wishing I had died out there.</p>
<p>The door boomed behind me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; I shouted.</p>
<p>It was Aashik. He said something I couldn&rsquo;t hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; I shouted again. The door was locked. I reached over and unlocked it, slapping it out with a wet hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; He asked me.</p>
<p>I slapped the water. &ldquo;Taking a bath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you feeling? You ran home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. I fell, too. Fucked my knee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you feeling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not too good. I'm going to throw up.&rdquo; I crawled to the toilet and began retching. Then I started to cry like I&rsquo;d never cried before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm sorry, Aashik,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m sorry, man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aashik, I&rsquo;m a piece of shit. I&rsquo;m a piece of shit, man. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything, man, everything. I don't have fucking anything. I&rsquo;m a piece of shit. I have nothing, man, nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I kept saying that over and over again and crying with my head against his leg. He put a towel over my back and his hand on my head and I heard him cry quietly, too.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>10.</p>
<p>JUST LAST MONTH I was at my brother&rsquo;s wedding. It was a very fine wedding. My brother rented out an entire restaurant at Bryant Park. We took our photos in front of the steps of the New York Public Library, at dinner there was steak, the waitstaff was offering plates of hors d'oeuvres, and my wine glass was fat the whole night. It was a rare experience for someone like me who doesn&rsquo;t make much money and lives with his parents.</p>
<p>I was one of the groomsmen and the ring-bearer. It had been humid the day before, but today it was cool, and the evening was coming. There were about a hundred guests seated on the terrace overlooking a large lawn of grass on which hundreds of New Yorkers were picnicking. Before them lay a stage over which a banner read: OTHELLO 7PM. I was wearing a tuxedo that my brother had had sent to me a week prior to secure its fit. My brother and his bride read their vows, something about loading the dishwasher and closing the kitchen cabinets, and while the other groomsmen beamed and chuckled towards them, I looked away.</p>
<p>I figure my brother and I have spoken about five hours in the past decade. The last meaningful encounter I had with him before the wedding happened about a year ago when he came home for a week. I&rsquo;d just gotten back to California after hitchhiking from Nashville. He came into my room one day just before I was going out for a run and asked me where his hiking pack was. I told him that I had sold it to my friend. That was you. He hadn&rsquo;t used it in years, and I thought he wouldn&rsquo;t notice it was gone or that he wouldn&rsquo;t care because he made a lot of money. He was angry with me. I asked him how much it cost. He told me I owed him $150, so I gave it to him right there in cash. He kept telling me not to touch his stuff. I told him that since I had just paid him, that was the end. He wouldn&rsquo;t stop, though, said he was only angry because I had sold it. It&rsquo;s the principle, he said. Man, I was thinking about how I was working from sunup to midnight putting up Christmas lights for 15 bucks an hour now, and I didn&rsquo;t want to hear him talk about principle. So, my mom standing between us, I put my finger on him and cursed him with a severity that frightened all of us. Then I left. I started running up near these hills, thinking about how my parents had to choose, him or me, because I didn&rsquo;t want anything to do with him anymore. When I got to the top and the whole city was in view I got to my knees and started to cry.</p>
<p>Couple weeks ago you told me that when you saw your mother for the first time in two years, she cried. I bet you saw her in a different way. Man, it&rsquo;s a shame that for all we think we&rsquo;ve learned, we still don&rsquo;t know how to be brothers and sons.</p>
<p>My brother and mother had their dance before the wedding dinner. They danced to the song &ldquo;Moon River&rdquo; by Audrey Hepburn. My mother approached my brother with that the hurt eyes of someone who&rsquo;s trying hard not to cry, and my brother&rsquo;s were big with the fear that she might fall apart in his arms. It was when I saw the light on her cheekbone that an image from a dream I had appeared in my mind: it&rsquo;s my mother on a bed. Her eyes are sunken in, her hair is white and floats in the morning light, and her bones poke from her skin and gown. She&rsquo;s halfway into another world now, more spirit than body. Looking at her now, dancing with my brother, I saw her as the little girl standing at her doorway as her sister lay dead, and I saw her crying about it too in the living room fifty years later. I saw her as the kid whose father told her to bring her back a pack of cigarettes. She went to the store, but along the way she met her friend, and they jumped rope until the sun went down. She came back home empty-handed, and her dad spanked her. When she told me that story, she laughed. I thought about her driving to the mall parking lot to cry because she didn&rsquo;t have any friends in America and because she wasn&rsquo;t sure who she&rsquo;d married. She and my dad ran a cleaner&rsquo;s when they came to America, and they worked day and night. One day she skipped work without telling my dad and took my brother to the park to ride his new bike. Later, he hit her. Man, I think about the shame of my mother walking around with a black eye, my brother knowing and not knowing.</p>
<p>After dinner I met eyes with someone I had spotted earlier, a man my brother has known since high school. He was there with his girlfriend. His name was Jason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember you,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;I remember thinking when I saw you: that&rsquo;s a good-looking man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed, and we talked for a few minutes. Then he looked me right in the eye and said: &ldquo;Do you know what your brother said about you a few days ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said that he was really hard on you when you were little. But he said that you were the smartest person he knew, and the best soccer player. &rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly after this, I was standing at the bar when another man approached me. He was my brother&rsquo;s friend from college. They had been in the same fraternity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;James&rsquo; brother,&rdquo; he said to me. We shook hands. He asked me what I was drinking. I told him I was going for a whiskey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do a tequila shot,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>So we did, with the lime and the salt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was going on with you up there?&rdquo; He asked me.</p>
<p>I asked him what he meant. He said that I looked like I really didn&rsquo;t want to be there. &ldquo;Who is that guy?&rdquo; He had asked his friend during the ceremony. That, his friend told him, is his brother.</p>
<p>I felt really ashamed for what I&rsquo;d done. I&rsquo;d promised myself that I wouldn&rsquo;t say a word out of line for the few days that I was in New York. It&rsquo;s my brother&rsquo;s wedding, I reasoned, and he&rsquo;s chosen me as one of his groomsmen and the ring-bearer. So I was thinking I&rsquo;d be gracious. But something had come over me as I stood at the altar: I saw inside me that I still hated him. I told the man that I was ashamed of myself. He told me that I should go talk to my brother.</p>
<p>The night continued from the bar to a club across the street, and I found myself sitting beside another one of the groomsmen who was heaving into a silver dish that was shaped like a dog&rsquo;s bowl. My sister had been coaxed into having too many drinks by the other groomsmen, and her boyfriend was trying to keep her upright on the dance floor. My brother came over to me, and I rose to greet him. He told me that he was sorry for how he had treated me in the past. He said that it hurt him when I didn&rsquo;t ask him to bail me out in Nicaragua, and he embraced me. Tears came freely down my face, and I put my arms around him. I saw him then as my strong brother, who was a husband now and a father soon, and I wished we could be real brothers.</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>11.</p>
<p>TWO DAYS after that night with Aashik, I was on the John Muir Trail. I figured it was time to head back to LA to my parents, and I thought I&rsquo;d do a long hike to get there. I took a train to Merced and hopped on a bus to get to Yosemite Valley.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a lot of extra stuff with me because I was moving, like my laptop and clothes and books, so I was packing close to 50 lbs. Man, I really overestimated my strength there. First day was a half day, so it was alright. It was the beginning of a long climb, some 6000 ft gain over 15 miles, I think. There were a lot of day hikers on the trail, too. Up, up, up. Second day was where it hurt. Man, crawling up, up, up while you&rsquo;re surrounded by trees. Not so many people around to talk to, either. I thought I was hearing voices in the scratch of squirrel claws gripping tree bark or the gurgling streams, whispers in the brush. Thought I was seeing tents where there were boulders and hikers where there were saplings. Eyes in the dark knots of aspens. I had to stop every ten minutes to rest, too. I didn&rsquo;t know how to properly adjust my pack so it was hanging off me and killing my shoulders. It was so heavy for me that I had to prop it up and sit down to get the straps on. My head was becoming a bad place. I got to a point where I was so tired that I got my sleeping bag out and went inside it for a few minutes just a couple feet off the trail. But I was thinking I&rsquo;d be embarrassed if someone saw me like that, so I took a couple bites from a bar and kept going. Five minutes later, Tuolumne Meadows opened up to me like a goddamn postcard. I never saw beauty like that before.</p>
<p>Brown brooks cut through a plain of lush grass carrying water so clear that you only knew it was water because the sun glittered on it. Between the granite domes on either side, deer grazed and leapt lightly from each other. I walked through that meadow in a daze that something like this was real, and that I was in it. Then I thought about what Aashik had done for me, and I started to cry. I got to my knees because I couldn&rsquo;t see where I was going. Man, to have a friend like him who&rsquo;d see you broken like that and cry with you. I promised myself that someday I&rsquo;d repay him for what he did for me. I didn&rsquo;t deserve that, and I didn&rsquo;t deserve to walk in a place as beautiful as this, or to be with the grasses and the brown brook, the deer, and the mountains, all of these things that were beautiful and didn&rsquo;t even know it. But it&rsquo;s been given to me, I thought, and I got to my feet and just kept walking through with tears coming down my face. I didn&rsquo;t want to live the way I&rsquo;d been living anymore. I wanted to be clean.</p>
<p>Couple years later I got that same feeling again.</p>
<p>After I got back from Bonnaroo, Taqueria opened a second restaurant a couple miles from the first. You and I were going to work there. We had a soft opening for family and friends, and I had a double that day. JC was being neurotic because Tony was there. I worked at my usual pace, but JC kept ordering me around. I hadn&rsquo;t eaten anything that day. The layout of the restaurant was different, all the napkins, plates, silverware, and towels were in different places, and learning all of this again was frustrating. I slowed down toward the end of the night as customers began to leave. JC told me to keep moving. I told him to calm down. He told me not to tell him that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calm down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked away.</p>
<p>Tony came over later and apologized to me. He told me I had to think about his &ldquo;main motive,&rdquo; that he wanted a happy restaurant, a happy family here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I told him that wasn&rsquo;t his main motive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, what&rsquo;s my main motive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your main motive is to make money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When my shift ended I rode my bike back to work. Cars rushed by in both directions. I went out on the middle of the road. A car stopped for me. I pedaled quickly past it. Then I got hit by a car, and I was thrown backwards. I saw the night sky swivel before me, and I had one very quiet thought, that that was that.</p>
<p>I hit the ground on my hip and my elbow and wrist, and as soon as I realized that I wasn&rsquo;t going to die&mdash;man, everything came up inside me, right from my chest, and I wanted to scream. I never felt strong like that before in my life. When I told you this story you said it was adrenaline, but I&rsquo;ve felt adrenaline plenty of times, and it wasn&rsquo;t that. Adrenaline&rsquo;s about survival, it&rsquo;s about you. This was different. It was the most powerful thing I&rsquo;ve ever felt&mdash;there was no shame, no doubt, no fear&mdash;it was only one thing, a single force in my whole body that was telling me what I had to do. I had to make things right with everyone in my life. My parents, my brother, my sister, and you. I was given a second chance.</p>
<p>A few weeks earlier I had gone off you. We were at a bar with Julio. Every Wednesday they had a buy one, get one special. My drink was five dollars so I tipped one. You sniggered, and I got angry. I thought about how you still owed me 800 bucks and how I had bought the motorcycle that we now shared and about how I had cooked for you at Lutsen and done things for you that you never noticed and how many times I wished I was travelling alone. All the way back to the car I shouted at you about how you were a shitty friend. You kept saying I was right and to stop. You said it was hard being around me, too. But I couldn&rsquo;t stop and I kept shouting at you. Couple days later when we were walking back home with a six-pack of good beer you turned to me and you said I had been a good friend to you. You said you didn&rsquo;t think you had been a good one. I was very ashamed when you said that because I was thinking about when I was at Bonnaroo with Carley. You sent me a text that you were going through a couple six-packs every day and that you were in a dark place right now. I remember looking at my phone and putting it away. Man, I&rsquo;ll never do that again.</p>
<p>When we first got into Nashville we were at that hostel on D.B. Todd for a few weeks. Couple weeks in I got a message from the hostel owner that we had to move out because we were messy. You and I were working at Taqueria when I got the message. I showed it to you, right by the double doors to the kitchen, and we looked at each other. Then we started laughing. Later you apologized to the owner and said that you were going through a hard time. You said I should get to stay because you had been the messy one. You told me you would find your own housing. But we moved out together anyway and found that house with the porch. We&rsquo;d get some good beer and talk for hours about everything on that porch. I never enjoyed a beer more with anyone than with you. We would ride on the bike together to go to work or to go grocery shopping. You drove because you&rsquo;re bigger than me. Maybe you&rsquo;re a better driver, too. On a nice stretch of road I would lean back on the seat rest and feel the way I used to when I was little and hung out with my big brother. I remembered how when this all started it was supposed to be you and me, Kerouac and Cassady, running and stumbling through the deserts and mountains and plains of America.</p>
<p>I got up from the street. There were headlights hurtling past me. I took my mangled bike to the sidewalk and limped over to the woman who had come out of the car that hit me. She was crying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay. It was my fault.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, God bless you,&rdquo; she cried, and I hugged her.</p>
<p>A guy who&rsquo;d seen the crash asked me if I wanted a ride home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I saw you die, man,&rdquo; he said as he drove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>I was going to get home and and hug you and tell you that you were a good friend to me. You were on the balcony smoking and listening to music. You heard me coming up. You asked me how work was, but then you saw me limping and you saw the look in my eyes. Your eyes got big and you made me sit down in your chair, and you lit me a cigarette. So I never got to do that.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think about poor Henry Treadway, poor Bernard Moon who&rsquo;d be starting his senior year at Brown now, my mom&rsquo;s sister waking up dead and her brother wanting to go to school, John, Richard, the little girl wondering how you can kill yourself, my mom asking God to help her with my dad, and my dad age four lying on the dirt and looking up at the stars wondering if his mother was ever coming back. I think about Alex as a kid punching her wall by her bed and wishing things were different and wanting her to know that I&rsquo;m there for her if she wants. My mom crying on my brother&rsquo;s chest to &ldquo;Moon River.&rdquo; I think about you sitting by yourself in Cafe Coco. You told your mom that it would be better to die than to live with all your worries. Then at the table you wept. I think also about when we went to the thrift store to find boots for you in Minneapolis. It was the middle of winter and we were about to go start work up at Lutsen. There weren&rsquo;t a lot of options because your feet are so damn big, but we looked and looked and I found you a pair. You laced them up and said, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re my friend, man.</p>
