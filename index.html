<center><h1>STORIES FOR A FRIEND</h1></center>
<br>
<br>
<p> </p>
    1.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I FIGURED THE BEST WAY to tell you this story is to tell it like we're back
    on that porch in Nashville. Come back late from closing at Taqueria, your
    brain fried and your back stiff because you had to mop up and roll all that
    silverware before you could go. Toss your tips into the money pile in your
    closet and come out for a beer and a smoke. The sun’s gold-red flare’s on
    the roof tiles and the waxy leaves, and the crunchy black street vibrates
    hot from the day. The air’s thick with water, strips the brown bottles of
    their wrappers and drips over our knuckles. There’s the great critter orgy
    all around, the sirens and clicks and belches like an orchestra having one
    big stroke. Mazzy Star from your phone. The puffs sharpen the pulls, the
    smoke shoos the mosquitoes, and the talking’s easy and filling, like a hot
    meal.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Couple reasons I dropped out of school and hitchhiked to Panama, one of
    them being that I spent my whole life being suggested into shit that was
    supposed to be good for me. I pretty much did the same stuff my brother did
    in high school—soccer, newspaper, distance track—and I even went to the
    same college. He's four years older than me so he was a fresh grad working
    as an analyst in San Fran when I came in as a freshman. Day of my
    orientation, he wrote me a list of classes I should take, said I might as
    well major in business like he did. I don't mean any disrespect to Cal or
    my brother because he was just looking out for me and because there's a lot
    to learn in a school like that. I know you got a lot out of your philosophy
    classes when you were there, like with Searle and Dreyfus, rest in peace.
    But my experience was with kids whose biggest interest in art was how to
    dress the part and professors who were talking about literary patricide,
    Great American Novel, and The Death of the Author. But I know I wasn’t
    ready to learn—if I could go back I'd try to get the most out it. I'd
    probably study philosophy like you or math like Axel did, if I’m up for it.
    Second reason I left was because I had just broken up with a girl named
    Alex. She was the realest thing that happened to me and without her just
    about everything around me went back to make-believe. Last reason, this
    sounds dumb, but the way things were going I knew I could have gone my
    whole life without knowing who I was, if I was strong or weak, brave or
    cowardly. You know how in some of the books we read when we were little
    there's the boy in the tribe or the village. He's not the strongest or the
    biggest kid, but he's got a brain, and a heart, too. When he gets a little
    older he leaves his home for a journey. His dad's solemn about it, but he's
    proud because it's something he's got to do. His mom's sad, and maybe his
    little sister’s so mad at him that she won’t even look at him when he
    leaves. But he goes and runs into people who need his help, and it's
    scrappy, but he helps them. Months and years pass, and he becomes strong, a
    leader. Then he comes home and no one recognizes him anymore because he's a
    man now, with the glint and the shoulders and everything. I wanted that, I
    wanted to be a man, and I wanted people to think I was one, too.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    The sky was a sad, solid pink with blue at its corners when I crossed the
    border out of San Diego into Tijuana. I walked till morning because I
    didn’t have the balls to stand there with my thumb out. The highway into
    the country was like a dying river coming down the hill. It was gray and
    smooth and had the inhumanity of Soviet buildings, how they look like
    they’ve built themselves. Now the metal garage doors were being pulled down
    over shopfronts, and I spun around to their sound, hands on my straps,
    because they were like distant gunshots. The houses were peeling concrete
    frames, almost like ruins, with corrugated tin roofs and chain-link fences
    or cement walls around them. I saw inside their homes with their small
    square televisions and bunny-ear antennas and their floors that were tile
    or or swept down to a cold bedrock. The walltops had glass shards caulked
    on them, and the windows of the homes had black iron bars. White vinyl
    banners on the homes and storefronts promoted pizza and cell phone plans.
    The men and women on the banners were handsome and light-skinned, almost
    Middle Eastern, although the sun had faded their ink to blue and yellow.
    There was a lot of trash. New trash, old trash, burning trash. Clear
    plastic wrappers, shredded tire like jerky, little hills of all the sand
    and rocks that go into cement, the mini snowballs of crumbled styrofoam,
    and plastic bags that were halfway-buried in the dust. Mutts with long
    girthy torsos and short legs. So mangy they looked part-hyena. Bitches with
    their droopy gray teats swaying and scraping the dusty streets, sniffing at
    shit on those sand hills. Sad, mellow dogs, not like their coked-up husky
    brothers in America. If you got near them, they trotted away and looked
    back at you with shiny hurt eyes.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    There, that night, two things I’ll never forget: first was a black border
    collie missing her scalp. She was lying under a lone bare tree by the road,
    and where her scalp should have been there was brain-pink scar tissue like
    someone had laid a huge wad of bubblegum on her. She was more scared than
    any of the other dogs as she got up all hurt and walked away. My heart got
    heavy looking at her go. Second: couple minutes down the road, the
    pink-blue sunset catching the crushed-up quartz on the asphalt: a dog run
    over so many times that it was only a hairy brown doormat, a chewed up cow
    cud.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    There were the taco stands that stood apart like lone cafes open late at
    night. Their owners were lit with the neon-white hospital lights you’ll
    find the closer you get to the equator. They flickered with thudding moths,
    under which meat stewed in deep pots that had a layer of drifting
    red-orange grease, like the innards of a lava lamp. Around the stands were
    plastic tables, chairs, and sun umbrellas which were either red or blue
    depending on if they were made by Coca Cola or Pepsi and bleached
    yellow-white at their corners. Mexicans spoke to each other quietly outside
    their homes and in their doorways as semis rattled past, which hissed and
    creaked like a whole factory on wheels, leaving their fumes in their wake.
    Fumes that smelled not like wood smoke but like sweat and school glue, that
    white goopy shit that dried like a blister on your hand and that you had to
    rub off like dead skin. I bet you were like me and always smelled your hand
    after. That's what those fumes smelled like. It was hot and quiet when
    there were no cars, and the short, fat Mexicans in their wifebeaters looked
    at me with my backpack all worried, pointing at me and whispering, like I
    was on the run.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    When you tell someone you hitchhiked to Panama their eyes go buggy thinking
    you had this great adventure, you know, diving off cliffs with beautiful
    Latin girls who are too poor and good to live off their looks, giving the
    thumbs-up to a camera while you’re scuba diving around all these tropical
    fishes. But the truth is that most of those six months on the road was
    spent <em>on the road</em>, walking all day and standing there with my thumb out,
    getting mad and sad when people would just stare at me or give me the
    thumbs-up back. I had no money so I slept outside a lot. I worked at a
    ranch, a hostel, on a boat, on an island, but I wasn't a good worker, and
    usually I took more than I deserved. I never been so low in my life. I used to think I was a lone wolf and I’ve always wanted
    people to think so, too. But I was broken inside missing everyone so much.
    Thinking about my friends, thinking about Alex, making up conversations and
    fantasies about seeing them again or re-doing things that I messed up.
    Towards the end I was getting pretty loopy—I was in my own movie,
    interviewing myself, talking about the scenery, laughing at my own jokes.
    Maybe you don’t know this, but you were about the only friend I had during
    that time, the only person I really talked to. One time you wrote me while
    you were teaching English in Korea. You said you always looked forward to
    reading the writing I put up, and you asked me when the next one was
    coming. I remember where I was when I read that email. I was at the border
    of Belize and Guatemala, and it was after I got caught stealing at a gas
    station in Belize. It hurt to steal because you had to invent new ways to
    sneak food out every day like it was an errand, it hurt to have to look
    back at the store to make sure no one was following you, and it hurt to eat
    the food even though I was hungry most of the time. That day there was a
    big Champions League game on, and I talked to the men there in English for
    a few minutes. Then I slipped a chocolate bar in my pocket and left. I went
    back to asking people at the station for rides, and I began eating it. One
    of the men came out.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “That’s good, isn’t it?” He asked me in English.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “This? Yes.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Where did you get it?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Oh, from the gas station back there.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Are you sure?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Yeah.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I have a video of you stealing that.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Yeah, I stole it.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Where’s your family?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “America.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Do they know where you are?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “No.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Why are you stealing?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I have no money.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Does your family know what you’re doing?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “No.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I left the station and walked up the road where a semi was parked. I
    knocked on the window. A black man rolled it down. He looked down at me
    sternly. I asked him if he was going west. I must have looked pretty
    helpless because he turned to talk to his wife who was Latin. He nodded at
    me and came out of the truck to let me in. There was a bed in the back of
    the truck. The bed was made, with a red, pilled fleece blanket and two
    lumpy pillows. I sat on it stiffly and looked out the windshield with them.
    Sometime into the ride the truck lurched and one of the arms of a trash bag
    between the two front seats fell off a hook. I scrambled to help the wife
    put the trash back in. She smiled at me and then at a space above my head.
    I looked back. Three girls were on a bunk above me. They looked at me with
    big eyes. Their eyes and their long skinny legs dangling over the edge gave
    them a doe-like quality. I thought it was remarkable that they hadn’t made
    a sound and I was sorry to them, sorry for being dirty sitting on their
    parents’ bed wearing no underwear, sorry for travelling like this, sorry
    for stealing. I spent the rest of that ride feeling their eyes on the back
    of my head. They dropped me off outside Belmopan near the border to
    Guatemala. I was in Belize for all of a day. It was night now, and we were
    under an orange arc light when I shook the parents’ hands with both of
    mine, and I waved to the girls who smiled at me. There was pity in the
    parent’s eyes in their last look down at me, standing there with my pack
    on. Shiny, all-seeing pity I was glad to be getting away from. I walked a
    few miles to a gas station. It was dark behind it with some small houses,
    almost like a little park. I unrolled my pad on the grass under a pine tree
    whose branches were low, put my pack under my head, and lay there. The pine
    needles were nicking my nose. That’s when I turned over to look at my
    grubby, cracked phone and saw your message. I don’t know how I got it,
    seeing as how there was no wifi, but I got it and I read it and it was like
    I was drowning deep and your message was a reed straw I was breathing through
    to save my life.

    2.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    LIKE I SAID, I was expecting to come back with some education, but the
    whole time I was thinking: Man, what the hell have I learned so far? So
    when I got back to Berkeley to go live with my friends, I was more lost
    than ever. This one night I was going to meet up with them at Albatross.
    The man at the entrance asked for my ID, but I'd forgotten my wallet so I
    left and started walking back home. It was a five-mile walk and I hadn't
    brought my earbuds so I tried to make myself sturdy for the loneliness of
    it. It was raining a little. I put my hood on and my hands in my pockets
    and tried to think of something nice. The leaves were brown and fallen and
    the ones that weren't stuck to the sidewalk like wet brown paper skittered
    on it like a child was pulling them along on a string. Only the homeless
    were out. Man, you know how it is here. They wear the clear ponchos flecked
    with rain and have blue tarps tied with bungee cord over shopping carts
    that look like they’re carrying a garage sale. They're everywhere, and at
    night you see them sleeping everywhere, too. Some in the recessed entrances
    of shopfronts. On the sidewalk, on the grass in People's Park, over the
    steam vents on campus. They sleep in worn sleeping bags on cardboard. Most
    of them pull their bags over their faces, and all you see is a covered
    mound.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    One of them didn't cover her face, and I recognized her as the woman I'd
    seen on my way to the bar. She was an Asian woman, Japanese was my guess.
    They've been here longer so they got more time than the other Asians to
    fall off. She was about 45. I always saw her sitting on the sidewalk of
    Telegraph near where people are always selling jewelry and spiritual stuff.
    She always wore a black beanie over her greasy bangs. Her face was always
    tanned unevenly like someone who's been skiing with goggles, and her eyes
    were always big like she was dazed. Couldn’t tell if it was because she was
    nice or on something.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I was walking by her on my way to the bar while she was spreading her
    sleeping bag out over a piece of cardboard. She was in front of a store
    that’d gone out of business. It was an empty store, just some furniture and
    rubble, a couple eerie white mannequins, and you could see all the way into
    it till it got too dark. Her flannel-lined sleeping bag was coming apart,
    the white stuffing poking out of it like it was an old stuffed animal. Man,
    I’d be so ashamed to camp out in public, and it’s a trip whenever you see
    people around here just lying in the bushes by the sidewalk. Anyway, this
    was somewhere on San Pablo, and I was pretty sure I hadn't passed Albatross
    yet, but I asked her to make sure.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    "Albatross?" I pointed down the street.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    She nodded and pointed the same way. "But you gotta buy me dinner first."
    Then she cackled, and that made me laugh.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    But now she was asleep. She had the sunken and puckered mouth of someone
    without teeth and that frown that kids have when they’re asleep after a
    long day of running around, like they’re really deep in a good dream. Man,
    how'd she get to be like that? Her parents were probably interned during
    the war. Maybe she was Hawaiian-Japanese. They wanted her to be a good
    student, and she probably was. How'd she fall off like that, though? Now
    she was that sister or that aunt that no one talks to, no one knows where
    she is.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    My dad's got a friend who owns a gardening supply store. Had it for years.
    He and his wife worked there all the time and made a lot of money. They’ve
    got a couple nice cars and a nice house. They got a son, though, who's
    homeless. They kicked him out because he'd steal all their shit and sell it
    to buy heroin. The mom started noticing a lot of her stuff going missing,
    like her clothes, jewelry, even a goddamn leather armchair. So now he was
    just hanging out with other homeless people. My dad said he saw him by an
    on-ramp one day. Just lying there all burnt in the sun. The parents, they
    said they'd done all they could for him, and that what he did was his own
    business now. Man, how can you say that? How can you leave your son like
    that? So that's it then? You did all you could, end of story? I don't know.
    I guess it's hard enough trying to get your own life right to worry about
    someone else's. And I guess it’s true that there’s a point where you just
    can’t reach a person anymore. I've never gone out of my way to really help
    anyone either. Just a couple days ago Alex had hit me up, wondering if I
    was back now. We caught up for a bit, and I asked her how she was doing.
    She told me she was having a little trouble in Seattle, how she wasn't
    doing so well in school right now, but what got me was that she said she
    wasn’t okay. She'd never said that to me before. I always knew there was
    something going on with her, ever since she was a kid. Once she told me
    about how her parents and her sister fought a lot, and how sometimes she
    would punch the wall by her bed. She was never sad or down when we were
    together, but I always had the feeling that I never got to the bottom of
    her. Now she was telling me something important, and I just said something
    like "Sorry to hear that." She said she'd be alright, and we talked about
    something else. I remember when we were eighteen and she was leaving for
    college all the way in Boston. We talked on the phone, and she told me
    about how all the kids were really great there and upbeat, how her roommate
    had Asperger’s and lay in bed all day watching her TV.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    When it was time to go, I said: "See you when I see you?" "I love you,
    too," she said. And I said, "I love you, too." She said she'd never said
    that to anyone. “So what do we do now?” I asked her. She said maybe it
    meant that we should always be there for each other. “Deal,” I said. I
    didn't think too seriously about that at the time. But when she told me she
    wasn't okay—okay, the truth is that it's not that important because that
    was a long time ago and she's probably forgotten all about it—but I should
    have kept my end of the bargain.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    All of a sudden I wanted to go back to that Japanese lady and wake her up
    and ask her what happened to her. But I didn't and never would. That's the
    thing with the homeless here. They love to talk. I figure it's because they
    got no one who'll listen to them. One night I was walking on the greenway
    that goes north-south along the BART line, and I saw a woman having trouble
    setting up an orange tent on the grass. Those dome tents are tricky by
    yourself, so I helped her set it up. The tent was new. The stakes were
    spotless. She didn't look dirty or anything, she could have been my
    friend’s mom. She looked about fifty, and she had this nice, thick mane of
    silver-gray hair. Anyway, she was really grateful and said I was really
    nice. She said she was an artist and pointed to her black bag, the big
    square ones that hold canvasses. I asked her what kind of painting she did,
    and she went on and on about being down and out, how she was saving for a
    studio right now, how her boyfriend had kicked her out, how his cat had
    scratched her eye, and how she'd had a bad reaction. She peeled back her
    eyelid and showed me her eyeball, and I leaned over and said "Oh, yeah."
    Man, she wouldn't stop. I told her I had to go and gave her a couple bucks.
    She told me to come visit her. That made me sad when she said that.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    There's a couple characters you see all the time around Berkeley. Like the
    guy Aashik and I always got a kick out of. He's an old Indian guy with a
    wiry afro that's turning white at the roots. He's always wearing a dirty
    tan tunic and matching pants. Something about his eyes, too. There was fire
    in them, like he was really good or really evil. The first couple times we
    saw him, up by Sproul Gate, we thought he was holding his hand out to me
    and saying "Asian, Asian." But later we realized he was saying "Any change,
    any change," which makes more sense.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    There's an old white guy who looks like he should be on a Roman coin. Got
    the white beard and the nose for it. I always see him lounging on some
    bench on campus, looking like he's eating grapes from the vine at a feast.
    He's always moving around with his big body bag, the kind that military
    guys have, only his is blue. In my head I called him Diogenes. One time I
    saw him reading him a paperback by those benches outside Dwinelle. I was so
    curious about what he was reading that I circled back around him. I got
    down on one knee to pretend to tie my shoe and got a look at the cover. It
    was one of those harlequin romances, with a Tarzan-looking fellow on the
    cover. With one hand he's holding a girl in a lacey nightgown, and like a
    ship's mast with the other. And the way I was looking up at him, you
    couldn't have seen it otherwise, but one of his hands was down his
    sweatpants. After that he became Caligula.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Caligula, he likes to sleep on this one steam vent on Bancroft, by the
    tennis courts. I bet you've walked by that vent at night and heard the rats
    down there going <em>scree, scree, scree</em> like they're fighting a rat war down
    there. I tried looking into that vent one night to try get a look at this
    rat colony. There was warm sticky steam coming out of it so it was hard to
    get a good look, but the steam took a break sometimes. I got my phone light
    out and put it to the grate. There were big, kitten-sized rats scrambling
    over one another taking chunks out of a burger that looked like it’d been
    put through a meat grinder. Ketchup, mayonnaise, BLT—the rats were all over
    it, sauce all over their whiskers. There was sauce all over the grate, too,
    so I’m thinking either someone stuffed it down there or the rats dragged it
    in. Rats, you know, they don't have bad faces. They're big mice. But their
    tails is what get me. Thick wormy things, like surgery scars or giant
    insect feelers. It was almost evil. You got to have something going on in
    your head if you can fall asleep over that.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    When I was still in school I once went to this Friday church service that
    my brother told me to go to. This sophomore named Nate brought Caligula
    there, and he just looked confused the whole time. I remember after it was
    over and I was on my way out, I saw Nate asking Caligula if he could pray
    for him. His eyes kind of bulged and he nodded. Nate thanked God for their
    meeting and prayed for his health and stuff. I sent a silent prayer over,
    too, that he could knock his habit of jacking off on campus.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I got to know Nate. He was nice to me, and I thought he was alright. He was
    really upbeat, the kind of guy you don't want to be around for too long
    because you don't want to be sullen around him and have him ask you if you
    want to talk. Kind of guy who’d just look at you with a frozen smile if you
    made a messed up joke around him. Everything's God's will, according to
    him. “If God wills it,” he says, like he's a Crusader. He was a short guy
    with the black plastic glasses and a big smile, big front teeth I remember,
    and if you weren't too smart then you might think there was something
    saintly about him. I had told him about my travels and how I wanted to be a
    writer, and he went around introducing me to the other churchgoers as Tom
    Sawyer.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    This one night he hit me up and asked me if I was free. We met by the
    Subway on Bancroft and Telegraph, right before Sproul, and the first thing
    he does when he sees me is he quotes a line from a story I shared with him.
    I remember the line, and it was a bad, self-important line. Hearing it from
    his mouth made me realize that. So we start walking through Sproul past the
    bulletin that's ten deep with fliers and past those trees that line the
    plaza. You know what trees I'm talking about? They're not too tall and in
    the fall they lose their leaves and their stubby branches look like
    knuckles. Knuckle trees, I think whenever I see them. Anyway, Nate tells me
    that he and his girlfriend are going to write a book.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    "About what?"
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    "About God.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    "What about him?"
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    "About his goodness. About his grace, and his majesty."
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Then he said the reason he wanted to talk to me was that he and his
    girlfriend wanted my blessing to write their book. Six years later, and I’m
    still waiting for that damn book.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Nate went to my brother's church in San Francisco, like the whole Cal
    church group did. That was a long drive, all the way to Daly City. I
    remember this one sermon by this guy named Pastor Ryan. Big brutish guy,
    liked to wear cardigans. He had this one sermon about selflessness and all
    I remember about it is him talking about how these pop stars rented out a
    whole hospital for the birth of their baby, and that made them selfish. And
    about how he bought an iPad for his son who didn't like to share it, and
    that was also selfish but not as selfish as renting out a whole hospital
    and kicking out everyone on life support. He liked to say things with real
    emphasis, even though what he was saying wasn't the kind of thing that
    needed it. At the end of the sermon he told us that when you get God, he'll
    move your bowels. That made me laugh, and a couple people turned around and
    looked at me. At lunch I sat down by my brother and tried to talk to him
    about what he got out of it all. This and that, he said. I knew he'd been
    sleeping for most of it. Head back with his mouth open. My brother does
    this thing where if he doesn't want to talk he'll just ignore you. You ask
    him something important and he'll get this dark look on his face and
    pretend he didn't hear you.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Reason I was going to church in the first place was that after I got back
    from Panama, I spent a month at my brother's. “Of course, man,” he replied
    when I messaged him to see if I could stay at his place. When I arrived he
    asked me if he could use my suitcase for when he went to New York to see
    his girlfriend. His was too small. I emptied the suitcase of my things. He
    took his things out of his suitcase and put them in mine. This suitcase was
    also his. He had left it at home four years ago, and I had used it since. I
    looked around his small studio apartment. There was barely any room. I
    didn’t want him to make room for me. I’d be okay just sleeping under his
    desk or something.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Did you break this?” He asked me. He jerked the suitcase handle again and
    again, but it wouldn't go in fully.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I don’t know.” He kept doing it, violently. I was praying for that handle
    to go in.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Did you break it?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I’ll fix it,” I said. “I’ll fix it.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I took the suitcase from him and set it down, putting my hand into the
    siding of the case to feel the metal and using the other to try to get the
    handle in.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Don’t try to fix it.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I stopped.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Just put the stuff back into the other suitcase.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I did as he said.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “You need to get a job,” he said once I had finished and looked up.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I agreed.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    He told me to take a shower. I stood under the hot water, and I remember
    thinking about how I wanted to stay under the water forever, how good it
    would be if the hot water could soften me so I could start taking myself
    apart under it, like peel my lips off and pluck my nose off and step out of
    my loose skin and have my bones crumble like sandstone between my palms and
    just go down the drain so I wouldn't leave a mess. I was a burden.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Only work I found was writing for a magazine. They had an opening for an
    internship and wanted some writing samples. So I sent in a story about my
    travels to the editor. It's about how I came by some money, went like this:
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    The road was new and black with shiny crumbs on its shoulder that crunched
    as you walked on them. It had bold yellow dashes that were neatly squared
    off on each end. The road curved through the pine forest. The air was
    colder and fresher here because of the elevation. Before I had gotten to
    the ranch I made camp in the forest and woke up to frost on the outside of
    my sleeping bag. But the goose down had lofted overnight, and I only felt
    the cold wind as a gentle tug. I imagined I was in the Pacific Northwest
    and that I was hiking through the primitive lushness of Washington with its
    big dinosaur ferns, redwood trees with the soft wet bark you could sink
    your fingernail into, and the dark damp soil that made your steps quiet.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    There were many monarch butterflies before me now. They were like delicate
    orange leaves that never fell. When I was little I read about how every
    year millions of them migrated to a forest near Mexico City. I thought
    about how fantastic that forest must have been to attract them, and that it
    must have had magical qualities. Now I knew that I was in that place. There
    was a photo in the magazine of thousands of them covering a big tree. It
    would have been grotesque like it is with pillbugs swarming all over a
    river rock or spiders with hair-like legs floating on top of one another in
    a dank basement corner. But the monarchs were beautiful in the way that
    they opened and closed like eyelashes upon the tree trunks, and the labor
    with which they flew, wobbly like a wet newborn calf. They were the color
    of your eyelids when you lie in the sun with your eyes closed, and around
    their wings they were polka-dotted with black and white like a dress a
    little girl might wear. To read that every year they made a great journey
    from all around North America made me think they were brave. It was always
    a special moment whenever I saw one as a child, and I was always trying to
    catch them because I hated to see them leave.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    A white car came around a bend and stopped for me.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “How old are you?” The woman asked as we drove. She was clean and neat with
    a gray blazer and her hair in a shiny bun. She looked about 35. Her car was
    clean, too.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Twenty-one,” I said. “And you?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Older than you,” she smiled.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    A few minutes into the ride she placed her hand on my thigh.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Your legs,” she said. “Do you run?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I used to, but not anymore.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “It's not common to wear shorts in Mexico.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I know. But I'm traveling. It's more comfortable.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Do you have pants?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Yes.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “In your backpack?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Yes, I think I'll change in Toluca.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “You should change now.” She pulled over suddenly and looked at me.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Okay.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    There was an old broken wall by the highway, and behind it was the pine
    forest with boughs of red-brown pine needles. It was dry and the ground was
    soft here and would have made a good place to camp. I went behind the wall
    with my jeans and put them on over my shorts. She poked her head behind the
    wall and walked toward me.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I held my hands up. “What are you doing?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I have to pee.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We got back in the car.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Is something wrong?” She asked me as we drove on.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “No, I'm just tired.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Toluca 7 km, read a green sign.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Where did you learn Spanish?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “In school. And here in Mexico.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I heard Asians have small penises. Is that true?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I don’t know.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Go like this,” She said after some time, and she lifted her arms
    shoulder-level.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Okay.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    She reached over slowly towards the water bottle between my legs. Then she
    placed her hand on my penis and squeezed. “Is that okay?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “No,” I said. “No.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Okay.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I told that story to a lot of people who thought it was funny, how that
    ride wasn't free, and was she hot and everything. Part of that story is a
    lie, though, and I only ever told Axel the truth. I did get a ride from
    someone who touched me. That's true. But it wasn't a girl, it was a guy.
    But the saddest part of that story is that as he drove off, he stopped for
    a second, and I saw his hand drop a couple purple bills from the window. I
    went and got some tacos with that money and ate them on a big rock by the
    gas station. There were ants on that rock carrying green shards of leaves,
    and I made a little game of trying to pick them up by their leaves and
    trading them with crumbs of beef from my taco.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    The editor of the magazine called me and said I could write for them. She
    said I was “exceedingly talented.” Someone like her had never told me that
    before, and that made me feel pretty good. Started projecting way into the
    future about how this was the start of how I was going to be a great writer
    by paying my dues as a journalist. So I wrote a first draft, a
    self-important thing that they rejected and a second one, another
    self-important thing that they rejected again. Finally I wrote about
    meeting Aashik in Cancún during my travels. They said it was very good, and
    that was a big relief for me. But apart from that I couldn't bring myself
    to write about things that were happening in Berkeley. They did give me one
    other story. This was during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The story
    was getting big because a couple Americans had gotten it at airports.
    Apparently the robotics department at Cal and a couple other schools were
    teaming up to fight it. I remember there was this one professor from Texas
    A&amp;M who said something like: "It's up to us to make a stand against
    Ebola." The funniest part of that story was thinking about all these
    college robots in West Africa, burying their dead and offering their
    condolences in their robotic voices. But I'm guessing the editors, they
    knew I was down and out, so I think they were just throwing me a bone.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I slept by my brother's bed on a twin mattress, right in front of the
    doorway. In the morning he had to step over me to go to work. It's painful
    crashing at someone's place when they're getting ready for work. My brother
    would always tell me to sleep on his bed as he was leaving. I put the
    mattress away when he left. He worked all day in finance. What exactly he
    did I never knew. ETF's, he said. He always came back really tired. When he
    did he would order food for us and we would watch a television show or a
    movie. We never talked, and he never asked me about my travels. Sometimes I
    cleaned his kitchen and bathroom, and sometimes I wrote. His windows were
    big and let in a lot of light. At night I took long walks through the city
    and listened to music.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    My brother's the kind of guy who likes to give you a moral and say things
    like "At the end of the day." Like this one time we were going to get some
    coffee, and he gave this homeless guy outside the cafe a buck. Then he
    turned to me and said: "You know, you'd think it's bad to give to the
    homeless because they'll spend it on drugs or something. But at the end of
    the day, it's only a dollar."
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    In all seriousness, though, my brother went through a lot to get to where
    he is now. Smart guy, hard worker. Now he's making more in a year than I'll
    make in a lifetime. Man, my dad was a real bastard to him growing up, used
    to beat the shit out of him and tell him he was incompetent. I remember
    hiding with my sister while my brother cried and being glad I wasn't him.
    Hard life, no mistake. My brother used to be left-handed for example, and
    my dad beat that out of him, so now he's right-handed. I remember when I
    was little listening to my mom and dad talking at the dinner table about my
    being left-handed, too. My dad was saying, "How's he going to hold a gun?"
    And I remember sitting up against the wall thinking, "Man, when the war
    comes I'm gonna be pretty useless.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    One night, not too long after I arrived at my brother’s apartment, he took
    me out to dinner. But first he said my shorts were too short, and he made
    me change. It was a nice place, everyone there looked pretty well-off. We
    were talking, and he was telling me that I should try to publish what I
    wrote on my website about my travels. I told him I didn't know about that.
    To be honest, I didn't think it was publishable. I told him it wasn't the
    whole truth either, that I had been through a lot more than what I put
    online.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    "Man, I really suffered," I told him.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    "You didn't suffer," he said.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    "How do you know that?"
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    "Because no one told you to go and because you could have come home anytime
    you wanted."
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    He said that if you went through something but didn't have to, it didn't
    count. It only counted if you had to go through it without a choice. The
    people in the Holocaust, those people really suffered.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    What the hell do you know, I thought, and I started to cry at the table.
    People around us noticed I was crying, even the server who came to fill our
    glasses turned around when she saw my face, and my brother was embarrassed
    sitting there with me. We left quickly and I cried more when we got back to
    his place because once you start you can’t stop and then you’re crying just
    because you’re crying and for a bunch of other reasons that don’t have
    anything to do with what got you started in the first place. I told him I
    couldn’t do it anymore, and I asked him how he was able to find any meaning
    in anything. He said he had God. How? He said that it just clicked for him
    sometime in his sophomore year. What do you mean it just clicked? He didn't
    know, but it made sense to him. I could tell he didn't want to talk
    anymore, so we got ready for bed. I took the mattress out from under his
    bed, and we went to sleep. Couple days later I left my brother's house for
    the weekend and never went back.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    3.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    THAT’S HOW I got to be back in Berkeley, walking home from Albatross after
    forgetting my wallet. I was crashing at Aashik and Axel's place now,
    sleeping on a red sleeping bag at the foot of Aashik's bed. They were cool
    with it, for the most part. You already know this because you’re a bum at
    heart like me, but you can’t be on equal footing with someone when you’re
    crashing at their place. I didn’t see much of them anyway though because
    they’d leave the apartment around six or seven and spend all day on campus
    going from class to library to class. Like I said, Axel was a pure math
    major and he was getting a music minor, too. Guy was in the goddamn choir,
    and they were always doing Requiem or Mass in B Minor. Aashik was a double
    major, too, business and economics, always doing work for a club or running
    some guy’s senate campaign. Real smart, industrious guys, dean’s list. A
    lot of friends, too.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    A man was walking on the other side of Shattuck Ave. His legs crossed over
    themselves as he walked and he was running into fire hydrants, trees, and
    windows. I jogged over and asked him if he was okay.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Yes.” He wouldn't look at me.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Come on,” I said. “I’ll help you.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I had him put his arm around me and we walked slowly together. He told me
    he lived near the Claremont Hotel which was a few miles away. He was short
    and round with gray hair and glasses. He wore a dark gray woo coat and
    carried a thick black messenger bag. His name was John. I asked him what he
    did for a living.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I value and sell smaller companies.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We walked down Shattuck and up Parker where it got darker and more
    residential. All of a sudden his legs buckled underneath him. I tried to
    grab his waist, but he fell on the cement.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I'm a piece of shit,” he said. He began to sob and to rock himself on the
    ground. “I'm a piece of shit. I'm a piece of shit. I'm a fucking loser.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I helped him up by the elbow. We started walking again. I asked him if he
    had kids.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    He had a daughter and a son.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “My son hates me,” he said. “He hates the shit out of me. He's your age. He
    hates me. I'm a shit dad to him so he hates me.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Why?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I’ve just never been around. My son hates me.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Because you’re never around?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Yeah.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Because of your job?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Yeah.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “What does your son like to do?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Play guitar and smoke pot.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Does he want to be a musician?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “He doesn’t want to be anything.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Oh.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I'm a terrible father. My son hates me.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We walked in silence. As we crossed a street John buckled again and we
    wheeled around as I tried to keep him upright. He lay on his back on the
    asphalt. His face was blank when he looked at me, like he w as a baby. I
    wondered if he was sober now. I helped him up and took his bag from him.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “So what was your plan?” I asked him. “Were you just going to walk back
    home like this?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Yes.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Why?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    He shrugged.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “You wanted to feel something?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Yeah.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    The Claremont Hotel’s highest tower and its palm trees came into view. The
    hotel was all white and glowed pool-blue from its base and from the base of
    all its palm trees. The hotel was like a white citadel from a different
    time, and it always hit you like an oasis when you saw it.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Almost there?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    He grunted.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Soggy brown leaves clung to our shoes. On the other side of the street a
    hooded, stooped woman shuffled home. Her face was tanned and wooden. Gray
    lines of hair came out of her hood. Her hands were in her pockets. She had
    thick short legs and small feet. She carried a tied plastic bag.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    John's arm tightened on my shoulder. He was huffing.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “This way.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We were in a rich neighborhood now. It was quiet except for the wind and
    the leaves at night. The houses were painted in dark colors and some had
    dark red brick on their first stories. They were large but not monstrous
    like those mansions you see in Southern California, where you don’t know
    what they’re trying to be. They had large front yards with big lawns and
    old big trees that were older and bigger than the houses themselves. None
    of the lights were on in the houses.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Almost there, right?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    He nodded.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “You gonna remember me in the morning?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    He snorted.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “You got a good story about you and your son?” I asked him after some time.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Yeah.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Okay.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    He didn't say anything for a minute, and I thought it was over.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “This is when my son was six or seven. It was after school. He'd just been
    diagnosed with diabetes. Doctor told him that he should start learning how
    to inject the insulin himself now because he'd have to start doing it for
    the rest of his life. That made him different to the other kids, and at
    first I think he got picked on a little. He was always a really shy kid.
    But he was always a little different, too. Like our collie Cleveland died
    one day. Old dog. My wife and I got him when we married. He died when my
    son was five, and for a good month he wouldn't stop acting like a dog.
    Wanted us to put him on a leash and eat from a dog bowl. Panting with his
    tongue out. Different. Anyway, we taught him how to use the needle, and
    this one day he had some friends over on our porch. I never saw these kids
    before, so I assumed he brought them over to show them something. Yeah, he
    was going to show them how he injected himself. They're all leaning over
    him, fascinated, and Caleb my son picks out a vein in his thigh and puts
    the needle in. But he can't get the insulin in because he hasn't got a good
    vein, so he tries again. And again, and again. So I'm just watching my son
    stab himself with a needle with this frozen look on his face, half joy,
    half, you know, horror.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Damn,” I said.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I should’ve taken that needle out of his hand.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Yeah.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Yeah,” he said. "I realize that it's not the story you were expecting.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “No.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Yeah.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Got any stories about you guys eating an ice cream or something?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    He laughed a little. "Fuck off."
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    The walking got easier and he let me carry his bag. “Here,” he said after
    some time. We walked down a long lamp-lit driveway to his house. It was a
    single-story, modest for the neighborhood, but nice nonetheless. When we
    were before his front door he fell again, twisting away from me and landing
    on the cement.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I don't deserve to live,” he said. His eyes were wide and his mouth
    quivered. His hands were up to his chest like he thought I was going to hit
    him.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Come on, John. We’re here now,” I said and helped him up again.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We entered his kitchen, which seemed to have signs of a family. There was
    an electric guitar hanging in the living room and a big television on the
    wall. The refrigerator was made of stainless steel and had no photos or
    those magnets you get from all the cities you visit. The house was clean,
    the furniture was modern and unscuffed, and there were clean throws folded
    neatly on the sofas. It didn't look like anyone lived there. I listened for
    anyone upstairs, a light to come on and a woman’s soft steps or the light
    crackle of a joint on the stairs and prepared to explain myself. But no one
    came. I found a glass in one of the cabinets on either side of his sink and
    filled it with water.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Drink as much as you can,” I said and placed it in front of him on the
    granite island. "Is your wife home?"
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    "She's with another man now."
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    "Sorry to hear that."
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    "She cheated on me. I knew the guy, too, we both knew him. He was my
    friend."
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    "Damn."
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    "You don't do that to another man."
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    "Yeah. No."
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    He nodded.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “You should get some sleep, right?” I asked after some time.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    He nodded.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I followed him upstairs and helped him into bed. I wanted to see something
    feminine in his bedroom like a make-up mirror or a lavender bathrobe but
    saw nothing. His bedsheets were gray and white, and his bedframe and his
    nightstand were made of dark wood.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Thank you,” he said.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    He motioned for me to give him my hand.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Thank you, thank you,” he said, and he kissed it twice.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I took off his shoes and set them by his bed. He closed his eyes. I went to
    his bathroom to fill his glass and placed it on his nightstand. Then I
    switched off his light and left.
</p>

    4.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    A LITTLE GIRL whose family’s close to mine, her dad killed himself after
    her mom and him got a divorce. I don’t know all the details, but they found
    him in bed with pills. From what I heard, before the divorce, he’d go to
    rehab for his drinking. He’d be good and ready to turn over a new leaf.
    Then when he got out he’d start drinking again. The little girl’s five or
    six now. Her family told her that her dad got sick and now he’s in heaven.
    I don’t know, man. I mean, I get it: you want the kid to be a kid. You hate
    to see her down or to show her how bad the world can get. She’s pure, for
    now. But of course she knows what happened, she knows she’s the only one in
    that family with her dad’s blood—and that dark stuff’s in her heart now.
    You try and bury it deep inside her by not telling her the truth, and
    she’ll only let that thing grow. Pretty soon it’s going to come out, one
    way or another. I bet she’s asked herself over and over again: Why’d my dad
    leave me? What’d I do wrong? How can you kill yourself?
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    How can you kill yourself?
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    When you’re little, killing yourself makes no sense because the world is
    beautiful. While my mom was running errands I’d lift up stepping stones to
    stare at centipedes with their red armor and their wriggling yellows legs,
    moist fat-banded earthworms half in the earth, glossy black stink bugs
    aiming their butts at us, rolly-pollies, pincher bugs, spiders and their
    white eggs webbed to the underside of the stone. Where I grew up, there
    were a lot of creeks, and that was a different world: water striders
    dimpled the water like it was made of glue. Sometimes I saw the tail of a
    water snake slithering away. One of the best things I’ve ever seen is one
    of those snakes, about a foot and a half long, with its engorged mouth on
    one of the hind legs of a bullfrog. Big frog, size of my fist. The frog was
    crawling up onto the creek bank with the snake holding on to it in the
    water. Its leg was all bloody. Man, I ran over to my dad shouting. I
    couldn’t even make a sentence because of how excited I was. We watched the
    frog try to crawl up the bank, and I tried to throw rocks at the snake to
    let it go. My dad wouldn’t let me. But I was so sure that the snake was bad
    for doing what it was doing. Poor frog, I thought, just trying to have a
    mudbath and catch some flies while this evil snake’s trying to bite off his
    leg.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I remember the minnows darting and gliding smoothly to a stop. I could
    never catch them because they were too fast, faster than tadpoles. Beneath
    them red crawfish snapped backwards in plumes of tan dust. The creek floor
    was scattered with their shells and their antennae that looked like red
    wire. If you were lucky you might see a box turtle with red on its head and
    yellow-edged shapes on its shell or a shiny yellow and black salamander
    resting on a wet rock. These, with the water snake, were the rarest
    creatures in the creek and to see one felt monumental, like seeing boobs in
    a movie. There were dark green frogs and purple-brown tadpoles whose
    spotted, translucent tails trembled in the water. They didn’t look anything
    like each other, and I couldn’t believe they were the same thing. One swam
    like a fish and nibbled on weeds, and the other sat on its haunches and
    hopped on land and snapped its tongue to catch flies. But some of the
    tadpoles had gangly hind legs and tails that were starting to shrink into
    their fattening bodies, and you thought: so it’s true then. Sometimes you
    saw a clump of clear, dotted jelly floating at the surface of the creek. If
    you looked closely you could see mini tadpoles, like commas, wriggling
    inside. One time I was reaching for some of those eggs, and all of a sudden
    a small frog the size of my thumb jumped on my hand, and I remember trying
    to turn the thing over to see if it was the mom or the dad.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    You could flatten your lungs to sit on a pool floor and feel both afraid
    and calm, and afterward your fingers would prune. Then later in the bath
    you could slick your hair up with shampoo. You could make shapes with your
    sister’s long black hairs that were stuck to the shower wall, like the
    outlines of cars or the profiles of faces. When you let the water out and
    leaned over the drain you saw it swirl around like a mini-tornado, and it
    sounded like when you sucked the last of your soda with a straw. On long
    drives the Californian sun followed you the whole way. The chalky white
    moon was out, too, like a fossil in the blue sky. You knew your way around
    town not by street names but by landmarks, like the freeway exit by the
    soccer fields, the gas station at the intersection, its prices on big black
    lettering on illuminated yellow signs, the big patchy field of the big
    middle school you’d go to one day, even though you couldn’t even imagine
    that day ever coming. But more than landmarks, you knew your way around by
    the feeling of a place. As you came back home late at night from the city,
    you went in and out of sleep for what seemed like days, but even in such a
    state you knew when you were pulling up to your home. Arriving felt like
    the end of a long journey, and falling asleep had the finality of death.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    You woke with the freshness of the morning when the sky was still gray and
    the cold air made you feel rugged once you put on thick socks and a big
    sweatshirt over your pajamas. You didn’t understand why your parents were
    so groggy in the morning, why they clung to sleep like it was better than
    life. You didn’t have time to sleep because there were whole worlds to fall
    into, the worlds you created with your toys and the fantastic worlds of
    your books.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    And you <em>felt</em>, man. <em>You felt</em>. There was the torturous anticipation of
    birthdays and Christmas. There was the darkly regal mood of a movie theater
    with its crimson curtains and carpet and the smell of popcorn. There was
    the nervous joy of your father lifting you up in the air, and the same
    feeling when your brother let you into his company. There was the joy of
    being your sister’s best friend, how it felt like her presence was just an
    extension of yours. Board games and Fridays and cartoons. New books and
    movies whose worlds were richer than ours. There was the dark pleasure in
    thinking about running away from home, how our parents would be sorry then.
    When we lost a game or when our parents scolded us our tears were hot and
    our fists were tight. When we cried there was nothing but the feeling that
    everything was against us, and sometimes we couldn’t stop. It took over us
    like a storm, and all we could do was endure it. But afterward our minds
    would be strangely clear. There was the exhilaration of seeing the girl you
    liked sit down at her seat in the morning. There was the joy of running out
    to play soccer with your friends at recess. There was the war-like will to
    win and the bitterness of defeat. You felt the brotherhood in defending
    your goal with your teammates and the courage of your goalkeeper. You felt
    the treachery of their betrayal if they switched teams. You felt the
    graveness of being down a goal as time ran out, and the desperation as your
    attempts to score failed. But when you struck the ball into the back of the
    net like it was something you hated, there was a second when you felt like
    you were underwater. Then pure joy took over you and your teammates and you
    ran around the field to everyone cheering.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I don’t know what happened to that little girl’s dad that made him do it,
    but I bet it was pretty cold and bleak in his head when he did. I bet he
    had never been more alone. I bet he had pain his whole life, and I bet the
    world was also beautiful for him when he was a kid like it was for all of
    us, but that things started getting bad when he forgot how to see. And
    before his little girl was wondering how you could kill yourself, he was
    wondering how you couldn’t. One hard morning, the white light coming in too
    bright, booze not enough, his little girl not enough, the pain he’d give to
    everyone around him if he did it not enough, he got that orange bottle from
    his medicine cabinet where it’s been sitting glowing for a while. Then he
    goes back into bed. Takes more than enough pills to see it through and
    looks around his room and sees everything like it’s for the first time.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    What happens to us that the world stops being beautiful? I figure you get a
    blank dictionary when you’re born. Everything is new, everything has
    meaning, and you have these really rich and full days where you’re touching
    and licking and playing with everything to get that dictionary filled in.
    I’m thinking that’s why children look dead when they’re asleep, like
    they’re way into a dream. But as you get older there are fewer and fewer
    new things. You find that you already have a definition for certain things.
    So instead of interacting with the real world, you just look up your
    definition of the thing you’re interacting with. Pretty soon you got a
    definition for almost everything there is and ever was in the world. The
    Vietnam War, dinosaurs, Hiroshima, the Black Plague, Kobe Bryant, Paris in
    the 20s and Berkeley in the 60s and Tenochtitlan in the 1300s, trench
    warfare, The Serengeti, that brown Louis Vuitton pattern, the legs of
    mid-century modern furniture, Saudi billionaires, what your grandparents
    went through, your father as a boy and your wife when you met her, your
    little girl, God, gin, and the rest of your life.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    When you were little, the world was a big mystery. But when you’re an
    adult, it’s all gray and rigid because you already have every definition.
    Or so you think. What you really have is the same bad dictionary that
    everyone around you has. You forget that you once had very good definitions
    that came from your own dealings with the world, and that they were what
    made your life so fun. But you throw them away because someone in your
    school makes fun of you for liking something, or because your parents fight
    in front of you and you’re thinking: “Man, I’ve been a fool not knowing the
    way things really are,” so you scramble to redefine everything. But mostly
    it’s a war of attrition—slowly, imperceptibly, all of your definitions are
    subsumed by the ones that everyone else has. Fear, that’s what makes us
    give up our own definitions, fear of being different, of being cast out.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    There is a right definition for every thing. I’m thinking that’s what
    artists mean when they’re talking about truth, that’s what Dazai meant when
    he said the masters “seemed not to rely in the least on the misconceptions
    of others,” and that’s what Rilke meant when he wrote that he was learning
    how to see. But when you only got that bad dictionary that everyone else
    has, you notice that in comparison to your childhood days you feel much
    less. You feel that there’s nothing new left in the world, that you just go
    about your day hopping from definition to definition. I mean, that’s why we
    drink and do drugs, that’s why we want to fall in love. Because for a short
    time you have the right definitions again. Makes you a kid, gives you a
    different pair of eyes. Makes you like people, makes you interested in
    them, makes you a better talker and a better listener, and it makes you
    forget about your troubles. World’s beautiful again.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    But without these things, time starts to move faster. A year as an adult is
    shorter and more forgettable than the length of a child’s full day. You
    might start to like being asleep more than you like being awake. Maybe one
    morning you’ll squirm to be more comfortable on the red sleeping bag
    because you didn’t bother to get out of your jeans and there’s a crinkling
    as you shift so you reach into your back pocket and find those bar receipts
    that you picked up for John the night before.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Man, the mornings were tough. When the light comes in, you can’t kid
    yourself anymore. You’re thinking, what kind of performance am I going to
    have put on for myself today? Every morning I’d wake up thinking I was
    going to make something of the day. Yes, yes, yes, I’d think to myself.
    Then it was like I had all these voices telling me I should go make myself
    a little drink from the rum we had leftover from a party, that I should
    listen to some music, watch a little video.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Most of the time I’d fantasize. There’s this scene in the movie <em>King of
    Comedy</em> where De Niro’s in his basement pretending that he’s having dinner
    with this famous comedian who’s trying to convince him to take over his
    show.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Just for six weeks,” he says.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “It’s impossible! I can’t even take over my own life for six weeks!” De
    Niro says. “What d’ya want, the tears to come outta my eyes?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Then his mom calls him from upstairs. ”Rupert! Whaddya doing down there?
    Who’re ya talking to?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Ma-aa!” He yells. “Puh-<em>lease</em>!”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    It’s a funny scene, clever too, because at first you think it’s real. But
    watching that made me want to itch myself out of my skin. Because that’s
    what I was doing all day, man, all day. I’m serious. Way more pathetic than
    that, too. And more evil shit that I won’t get into. There’s that one Star
    Trek episode of <em>Black Mirror</em> where this anti-social programmer guy has his
    own virtual world. Somehow with DNA samples of everyone in his office, he’s
    able to clone them perfectly into his world, which takes place on a
    spaceship called the USS Callister. That’s the name of the episode. This
    programmer, he’s the captain of the ship, and he can do whatever he wants
    with his co-workers including his boss who shits on him and this new cute
    girl he clones in. He hurts some of them, sure, but he doesn’t even give
    the women genitalia. I thought that was pretty convenient. Think about it,
    if a messed up guy like that programmer could be the God of his own goddamn
    world, what do you think he’s going to do to his boss and that cute girl
    and all the women in the office? It’s going to get dark real quick. I mean,
    I get it, you can’t make it too messed up because it’s TV. But man, the
inside of your head, that’s where you <em>are</em> the God of your world, and it can
    get real evil and sad in there and maybe you think it’s your own little
    secret, but it all comes out in one way or another. And people can tell,
    too. They know when you’re off because you always give out more than you
    want to. Anyway, what I’m trying to say is that <em>King of Comedy,
    Callister</em>—that’s baby shit. You get inside the head of a pretty good guy,
    you’ll find sicker stuff than that. And I was sick, man, real sick.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    But the morning was too early for anything serious. I would have a couple
    moments of conviction as I listened to music. Then I would have a drink as
    a reward for having a moment like that. I drank what alcohol I could find
    in the kitchen, then I’d look at stupid shit on the internet.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I couldn’t focus, man, not on anything. I just couldn’t do it. I’m thinking
    I had some attention problems, sure, and if I had more modern parents
    they’d have put me on some drugs for sure. Thank God they didn’t. Real
    genius move, drugging your kid because he can’t sit still. The real problem
    is that that there was nothing to focus on. No point. I remember reading
    about how during the French Revolution this one asylum emptied out because
    all the patients went to join. Some life-or-death stuff was happening, I
    figure, so they finally had some kind of purpose. That’s the problem with
    today—the stakes are too low for anyone to care. I kind of felt giddy
    dropping out of school because everyone makes it out to be this big thing
    like you’re throwing your life away, but when you do it you realize that
    nothing’s changed. It’s kind of like when you’re in the middle of a
    nightmare. Other night I was dreaming of driving a car on this mountain
    road, and for whatever reason I always drive it off a cliff like I’m on a
    track to thin air. So I’m in the air waiting to die, all the trees are
    coming at me, and then I wake up. I wake up and still half-asleep I’m
    thinking about how much it’s going to hurt, like my head going through the
    windshield and all my bones going crunch like when you bite on the end of a
    chicken wing, and that it’d be better to die than to be in a wheelchair.
    Then I think: wait a minute, all that’s null and void now, and I feel real
    light and giddy.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I’d spend the morning drinking until I felt the warmth of Alex’s presence.
    Then it’d be time for my nap. I’d stumble over to my sleeping bag on the
    floor of Aashik’s room, and Alex would be there beside me. I would kiss my
    forearm as if it were her shoulder. I would bring her hips toward mine. I
    felt such a tenderness for her, I wanted to tuck my head into her neck and
    smell the roots of her hair behind her ear like I used to. It smelled
    faintly of fennel, like her mouth did in a deep kiss. I don’t know if you
    know what I mean, but that fennel scent—that was part of her essence, part
    of that thing that comes to mind whenever you think about someone. I wanted
    to tell her everything, man, I wanted to tell her that I had nothing going
    for myself and that it was hard to imagine living like this for the rest of
    my life. I wanted her to tell me that none of this was true and how could I
    think that? I’d nestle deep into this warm world and go through my
    fantasies before choosing one that would take me away:
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <em>Her face is flushed and shiny as it is when she’s out of breath or after
    we’ve made love. She has a box in her arms. She holds it above her swollen
    belly. She sets the box down with the others and wipes her temple with her
    sleeve. I take her hands and we slide in our socks across the empty wooden
    floor.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    No rules?
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    No rules, she smiles.</em>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I'm telling you, waking up from those naps was the worst part about being alive.
    Man, consciousness just comes into your head like a sickness, like you’ve
    just heard some really bad news which I guess is that you’re you. Put it
    this way, when you haven’t eaten all day you want to bite into a juicy beef
    patty with some melted cheddar on top, and when you’re dead-tired you want
    to close the curtains of your room and fall onto the mattress of your bed.
    And when you do, there’s a deep satisfaction that perfectly complements the
    hunger or the fatigue. A perfect fit. I know you’ve felt this loneliness or
    this emptiness or this ennui I’m talking about, and that the pain lies in
    the fact that its complement doesn’t seem to exist. No one, no thing could
    remedy it for you. All you can do is lie there like you’re naked on a
    cliff’s edge during a storm, till it goes away.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I lay in my sleeping bag for most of the day, so I’d hear things through
    the wall. Sometimes the clacking of fingernails on the drywall, the
    scuffing of hair and a skull thudding against. I figure our neighbor’s got
    her bed right up against the wall, and her head’s right by mine. It’s nice
    to think about. I know it’s a girl because sometimes I hear her talk on the
    phone with her head against the wall. I can’t make out what she says
    exactly, only the emotion behind it, and I hear her laugh, too. It’s a good
    laugh, like she can really let go and lose herself in whatever’s making her
    laugh. That’s a good trait to have, and people will really like you for it.
    Sometimes I heard her cry. Not an all-out bawl, but when you’re choked up
    and sniffling. One time she had a really hard cry, though. The wall was shaking with her shoulders, and she kept trying to breathe it out. But it’d catch her in the throat, and a heavy, thudding sob would follow. There was a metallic timbre to them as they resonated with the metal studs within the walls. I got a glass from the kitchen and put it gently against the wall to listen.

</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Do you remember when we first landed in Nashville after we rode the bike
    from Lutsen? We’d been camping by the Parthenon and eating fast food. Well,
    one morning when the bike wouldn’t start we went and got some motor oil for
    it. We walked in a light rain, looking and feeling like bums, till we got
    to these train tracks. The white arm was coming down, beep, beep, beep. We
    heard the heavy chugging and felt the ground rumble and waited. And
    for a good minute or two, we watched the old freighter beam past us like it
    was powered by some ancient force, and it brought forth all those images
    and feelings of an old America, the settlers in their hoop caravans and
    dresses and buckle shoes, the Wild West, Carnegie and Rockefeller, Kerouac,
    and an earnesty and an innocence, too.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “That’s the best art we’ve seen in a while,” you said when it passed.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    When I had that glass up to that half-inch of drywall between me and that
    girl trying to keep it together, I thought the same thing, too.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Sometimes I think I'd be better off in prison. Maybe I could get something
    done if someone locked me up for a couple years. Every Tuesday my library
    back home’s got this used book sale. Every book’s either fifty cents or a
    dollar, depending on if it’s a paperback or a hardcover, and every time I
    go there I get a couple books. There are a lot of books in like-new
    condition there. I figure it’s all the adult children of the old people
    clearing out their childhood homes when they die and donating all their
    books to the library. That’s my guess because every so often you’ll open up
    a nice edition of a classic and you’ll find an inscription. Other day I
    bought a nice hardcover poetry book, and when I opened it I saw that
    someone had written, in really nice handwriting that no one’s got anymore:
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <center>Al,
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Warm friends lie within these pages ...
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Happy Anniversary, with love.

    It’s sad to see, because you can tell when no one’s read the book because
    none of the pages are bent and they still smell new. I like to do this
    thing where I’ll open up an old book that no one’s read before, to a brand
    new page, and I’ll think, that’s the first time this page has been in the
    light. But I get it. Reading’s hard. I’ve got hundreds of books now, and
    I’ve only read a couple dozen of them. One of the books I had with me while
    I was travelling through Central America was <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>. That’s
    a big book. When I told you I was reading it you asked me what the epigraph
    meant and who my favorite character was. Yeah, I never read that goddamn
    book. Ended up giving it to a Cuban named Magdial in Nicaragua. How I met
    that guy is a long story, so I’ll start with how I got into Nicaragua.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I wasn’t allowed to enter Belize because I had no entry stamp into Mexico,
    so I climbed a fence in a duty-free strip of stores close to the border and
    walked a few miles through jungle until I got to a highway in Belize. There
    are dirt paths near every border that locals use to go between countries,
    and I used them to cross into Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and
    Nicaragua.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    They caught me at the border of Honduras and Nicaragua. I came out of one
    of those trails onto the road and an immigration car stopped me and asked
    me for my papers. I told them I’d been hiking in the hills and didn’t know
    I’d crossed the border. They took me back to the office and searched my
    things. I palmed a little bag of weed from my pack and put it in my pocket
    while I was helping them take my things out. They told me I had to pay $70.
    I said I didn’t have any money. They said to come back with some, but that
    they’d keep my passport with them. I told them they couldn’t do that, but
    they wouldn’t give it back to me. I shouted at the man that I needed it to
    survive and to please give it back. He did but took my driver’s license. I
    went back onto the trail and came out about a mile ahead of where I had the
    last time and continued into Nicaragua.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    A family of five in an old pick-up truck took me a few miles before the
    Costa Rican border which is called Peñas Blancas. I sat in the back on some
    boxes of lettuce with an old man and his two grandsons. The calm shore of
    Lago de Managua was only twenty feet away on our left, and it looked like
    it must flood the road when it rained. The gray-brown volcanoes Concepción
    and Maderas were on the lake's island, Ometepe. They were stout and matte
    and looked flat against the horizon. There were a lot of active volcanoes
    along the coastline of Nicaragua, and they smoked and rumbled the towns. At
    night when everyone was inside their homes, there was a strange silence in
    the towns. The insects and birds were silent, and you only heard the hum of
    electricity. I felt that rumbling inside of me, like something big was
    about to happen.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    The wind took our words from our mouths so we pointed at the lake and the
    volcanoes and smiled. We stopped a few times to cool the engine with water.
    There were mango trees along the road. Each tree was forty feet high and
    carried hundreds of small plump yellow mangoes. There were hundreds of them
    on the ground, some rotten and swarming with ants and already part of the
    ground and others that were mottled and soft and goldenrod. It was easy to
    kick some leaves around to find the good ones, and we returned to the truck
    bed with them in the bellies of our shirts. We started up again. Warm
    syrupy juice spiraled away into the air as we sucked on the mangoes. The
    pulp stuck in my bottom teeth. The boys and I made a game of throwing the
    slimy flat stones as far as we could into the dry fields. If you threw it
    like you were skipping stones on a lake shore then it cut nicely through
    the wind before it fell curving down. The grandfather smiled at us and gave
    me a bag of water. It was cold and dripping. I tore into the plastic with
    my teeth and emptied it down my throat. He put his hand out for the plastic
    and smiled as I wiped my mouth.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    They let me off at the border. I doubled back and turned west into the
    yellow grazing fields and hiked through a few miles of light and dry
    jungle. The roots of the trees here were dry and came off the ground like
    thick, dusty vines. There were a few cattle fences too, along the way,
    three or four horizontal, barbed wires held up by vertical branches that I
    jumped over. I decided to stay west of the highway entering Costa Rica and
    to keep it in sight. I hopped over a dry riverbed. There was a tree whose
    roots were like that of mangroves, though there was no river here.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <em>“Ey!”</em>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I startled. A man sat in the shade of a big tree. He had a white LA cap, a
    purple shirt, and white shorts. He said his name was Charlie and tossed his
    passport at my feet. It was true. He said he’d been waiting in the grove
    for a friend who was coming illegally from Costa Rica into Nicaragua. His
    friend was bringing Charlie's girlfriend. She's black, he said, so it's
    more dangerous for her. He said that just beyond the clearing were patrols
    of Nicaraguan military and Costa Rican immigration. They were staking the
    river that bridged the border because it was a point of territorial dispute
    for the two countries. They were also on the lookout for illegals. Charlie
    said he would guide me part of the way and that he had crossed four or five
    times already. He said it would be dark in an hour.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We sat under the tree. I told him about my travels and showed him some
    pictures on my camera. I told him I wanted to get to the World Cup in
    Brazil.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “La Mundial? Puta. There are a lot of black women in Brazil, right?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Probably. More than here.” I reached into my bag and tossed him a mango.
    His eyes lit up when he caught it, and we ate together.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We began before it was completely dark, before the hills and the trees were
    black with the night sky. Charlie walked fast. His arms swung loosely. I
    hunched myself as I followed him and I clutched my backpack straps if I had
    to run. About an hour in we saw a man in white leaning against a tree.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Shh, shh,” Charlie said. “Inmigración.” He began to approach the figure
    like he was going to play a prank on him. Then he spun around suddenly and
    sprinted past me.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
   <em> “Ey! Ey!”</em>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We ran through the brush, swishing noisily. I hadn’t eaten that day besides
    those mangoes and was weak and hungry. We bounded over tall grass. I felt
    my heart throbbing at my temple. I looked back and saw a wild beam of light
    flailing into the night sky like an unleashed hose. We dropped onto our
    stomachs and breathed silently into the ground. Dust entered my mouth. I
    gathered spit in my mouth and let it drip down.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Why did he stop?” I whispered to Charlie.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “He’s afraid,” he said. “There are robbers around here.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We moved parallel to the highway. Charlie patted his pockets and cursed. He
    had lost his phone and his passport. I told him we could go back and look
    for them where we were lying down.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “No,” he said. “They're gone.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We saw two more white officials walking the opposite direction on the path
    to our left, about fifty feet away. Military and immigration travel in
    pairs, he whispered to me. I asked Charlie to take of his white cap and his
    white shorts. He took off his shorts and wrapped his cap in them. Then
    three figures carrying bags passed quickly by us on the path. They didn’t
    notice us.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <em>“Ey!</em>” Charlie whispered.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    They were two men and one women also crossing the border. They were sharp
    and wary, and they walked on quickly. We walked fast once they were some
    distance away. I wanted to think we were safe now. I wanted to see homes
    and lights and stores.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Charlie stopped. He said he was going back now because the way was clear
    now. I thanked him. I saw him walk back. I moved on. Then I saw two black
    figures coming toward me. They had the stocky builds of soldiers in
    uniform. The nozzles of big guns came out of their silhouettes. We stopped
    and looked at each other.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <em>“Ey! Ey!”</em>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I ran toward the brush. Charlie had told me they wouldn't shoot. He said
    they would only shoot into the sky as a warning. I ran through the brush
    toward the highway. My backpack bounced up and down, and I cursed.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <em>“Ey! Ey! Ey!”</em>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I waited for a bullet in my back. I wondered if it would penetrate my
    backpack, my laptop and my clothes and all of the small things along the
    way. I heard them in the brush behind me. Then I was stuck. There were
    vines across my legs. I tried to burst through them, but they were too
    strong. I grunted and kept pushing with my legs and dug them into the
    ground. I could hear them getting closer so I bounced off the vines and
    fell backward on the ground. I growled and righted myself and ran again.
    Then I tripped on a root and they were above me.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <em>“Don't move! Don't move!”</em> A gun was dug into my chest.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <em>“Okay okay okay okay okay!”</em> I said. I put my hands on the nozzle of the
    gun. Man, I never had a gun on me before. I wondered if a bullet could go
    through both my hands and into my body.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <em>“Don't move!”</em>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Okay okay okay okay. Okay.” I lay still.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    They pulled me up. One of them grabbed a fistful of my shirt. His nails dug
    into my chest. He put his light on my legs. I looked down and saw that
    there were many long curving cuts on my thighs. The tops of my socks were
    yellow and red. I looked at the vines I could not break through and saw
    that it was a barbed cattle fence.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Pobrecito,” he said.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    He put the light in my face. “De donde eres?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Los Estados Unidos.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “¿Americano?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Si.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    He turned to the other one. “¿Americano?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I was taken back the way I came. They asked me how much I was paid to guide
    the others. I told them I wasn’t guiding them. They told me to call for the
    others. I told them I didn’t know their names. They told me to call for the
    others. I told them I didn’t know their names.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    They brought me to a military post. It was an old abandoned home with a tin
    roof and concrete floors. The captain there shined a light up and down my
    body and stopped at my legs. He whistled.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “While you were running?” He asked. He was a big Spanish man with a
    mustache. He had on the green uniform and black leather boots.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Yes. Can I have some water?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    The captain called to the two men for water. They brought a plastic jug to
    him. He drank from it for a long time.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Ahhh,” he said when he finished, and he wiped his mouth. He handed me the
    jug. There was only a little left.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We went inside the house which was bare except for a table and two chairs.
    He had to sit down with his legs far apart because his thighs looked like
    they were going to burst. There were cracks in the floor and yellow tufts
    of grass growing out of them. The house smelled earthy and dusty from the
    dried bat feces.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “The wire?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I nodded.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Why did you run?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I heard your men …” I didn’t know how to say “cock their guns” in Spanish
    so I said “chik-chik” and mimicked the action.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    He frowned. He took out his walkie-talkie and asked one of the men who
    brought me if this was true.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    He turned to me. “He says he dropped his gun. He says that's what you
    heard.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Mentiroso,” I said.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    He made a note of everything in my backpack. He even counted all the change
    I had. If I struck him in the head hard enough, I thought, I might be able
    to escape. But I’ve never struck anyone in the head before.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I was driven to a military base in the back of a convoy with another
    soldier. I thought about jumping out of the back. The soldier saw my eyes
    and told me to calm down. The metal gates of the base opened into a large
    concrete yard. They brought me into a drab, dusty room. It looked like an
    old principal’s office. There were a lot of crates with files and an old
    computer turned to its side in the room. An old man with bushy gray
    eyebrows sat behind a desk there. His uniform had a lot of stars and
    tassels. He asked me who I was, very close to my face.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Are you efeh beh ee?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “What?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Are you efeh beh ee?!”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Efeh beh ee? Efeh beh ee, FBI? No! I'm a student,” I said in Spanish. “I'm
    traveling!” I forced myself to laugh. I reached into my wallet for my
    student ID. “Look!”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I can read,” he said. He stared at me. He asked me how much I was paid to
    guide the others, who they were, how I knew the way into Costa Rica.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I told him I knew nothing about that.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    He searched through all of my things and took photos of everything. He had
    problems working the flash.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “You don’t want flash, man,” I said.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Sit,” he said.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    He went through my notebook and took photos of some pages. I sat up in my
    seat to see which ones.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Your diary?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Yes.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Are you worried I'm taking pictures of it?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “It's my diary. It’s personal.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “You write a lot?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Yeah. You?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    He told me to empty my backpack out onto the table. I left some small
    things in the pockets. He took my backpack upside down and shook it onto
    the table. He took photos of my cuts and mugshots of my profiles. A medic
    took me into another room. She used one tongue depressor to spread the
    white cream over my cuts. Then she dipped it into the jar again and again.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We drove to the border immigration office a few miles north. I was
    questioned again. It was close to midnight. They went through my backpack
    again and made a note of everything that was inside. They sent me to sit on
    a bench in the lobby. Some of them came over and took photos of my thighs.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Great,” I said. “Great.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I would be taken to Managua tomorrow morning. They took me to a cell in the
    back of the building. There were two bunk beds with thin blue mattresses.
    There was a cot for the guard outside my cell. There was a woman who was
    white with curly hair and rectangular glasses. She asked me what had
    happened. I told her. She told me to put my hands through the barred window
    on the door. She held them in hers gently and examined my cuts and asked me
    more questions. I was too tired for that. Another official came in and told
    me to give him his hands. He handcuffed me. Orders, he told me. I asked him
    if he would give me a book out of my backpack. I have three, I said. No.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    There were the messages and tags of other apprehended illegals written on
    the white cinder block walls. There were names with dates and quotes. Some
    of them were only a few days old.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <center>Trust in the Lord with all your heart
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    and lean not on your own understanding.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    In all your ways submit to him,
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    and he will make your paths straight.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    - James, Ghana</center>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I lay on one of the bunks with my cuffed hands on my chest and my knees up
    so the blood and cream would not get on the mattress. I felt the metal bars
    of the bunk under me. I was thinking about how great it would be if I could
    stop time. In the morning I’d uncuff myself. Then I’d find my passport and
    stamp it twice for entry and exit. I’d walk south, take a car and drive for
    a few days. Race down the aisles of grocery stores in shopping carts and
    eat whatever I wanted. But if time was stopped then wouldn’t air molecules
    be suspended? So how could I breathe? Did matter beyond my body keep their
    properties when time was stopped? Was water still wet, was the sun still
    hot, did air molecules vibrate to make sound? Would I be able to swim or
    would the ocean look like water but have the properties of ice? It
    shouldn’t be possible to disturb matter when time was stopped. Otherwise
    the matter I disturbed would disturb other matter which would disturb other
    matter. Did time stop for my organs? Would food go bad? No, the food would
    never go bad. It would never be hard or impossible to move. I’d spend a
    week on the beach, find a room in a great hotel and eat anything I wanted.
    The water would be normal moving water so I could swim. The mosquitoes
    would leave me alone. I could practice riding a motorcycle for a few days,
    I could learn how to fly a small plane and go around the world, I could
    come back home old.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    5.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    IN THE MORNING, still handcuffed, they took me in a nice white pick-up to
    the detention center in Managua a few hours north. Are these really
    necessary, I said with my hands out. It was just a little joke for myself.
    The car smelled new inside and had air-conditioning. I was thinking it
    would have been a nice ride past the lake and the volcanoes again if I
    weren’t going to jail. The center was a plain single-story building, almost
    like a library you’d find in a small town in the midwest. I hiked up my
    shorts to expose my cut thighs when I entered. Everyone stared at me and
    then at my legs. There were about 40 detainees. They were men from
    Bulgaria, Ethiopia, Ghana, Somalia, Syria, Bangladesh, Pakistan, India,
    Nepal, Tibet, Cuba, and Peru. They were refugees who were making their way
    up to America by seeking asylum in each country along the way.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    There was Magdial from Cuba, Adnan from Syria, James from Ghana, and Chris
    from Oklahoma. He was the only other American. I can’t remember the names
    of any others, though I do remember their faces. But a name anchors a face.
    Without it a face eventually blurs into a soft, ethnic composite. Of the
    forty men I was the only one traveling south. Everyone but Oklahoman Chris
    was going north to America. He was a short and stout man, and there was
    something motherly about him. I told him it was good to meet another
    American and to speak English. He had been taken in by the police because
    he was drunk in the streets of Honduras, and without a passport, had been
    brought here. He said he had a Honduran wife and kids and a hog farm. I
    asked him what was going to happen to him. He was sad when he said that he
    would probably have to leave his family and go back to America.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Countrymen stayed together. Ghanaians played ping-pong in the courtyard.
    The ball had a hairline fracture and bounced dead sometimes. Indians played
    cards in the yard, Bangladeshis puffed smoke out the barbed-wire fence
    toward an empty lot. Magdial, Adnan, and I spent our time together. Adnan
    was a tall and serious man with a shaved head. He was an accountant who’d
    left Syria’s civil war a few months ago. Magdial, who was from Cuba, told
    me about how he had flown into Brazil from Havana. For six months he and
    Adnan had made their way north. With a local guide they had hired, he and a
    group of other refugees crossed the Darien Gap by foot.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “The fucking FARC, man.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    During a river crossing with only a line of rope from bank to bank, an old
    man had nearly drowned. Just go yourself, he told Magdial. But Magdial
    managed to drag him through and they lay on the bank.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “It was our lives, man! Our lives! Fuck! For me, this isn’t traveling. For
    me this is life and death.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    When he asked me why I hadn’t just crossed legally I didn’t have an answer.
    I felt pretty dumb. As an American I had to pay a fine of $80. Aashik wired
    me the money immediately and another $70 on top of that. Some of the other
    men wouldn’t be processed for weeks. A tall Bulgarian man with the severe
    nose told me he had been caught at the border and sent to prison for six
    months before he arrived at the detention center. He showed me the bedsores
    on his sides from having to sleep on the bare floor.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    James from Ghana slept across from me. He was always lying in his bed and
    looking up at the bunk above him. Whenever he walked by me I’d give him a
    nod. He’d just look at me. I thought he was sick or in pain or something. I
    saw him kneeling by his bed on the second day, and when he was done and had
    dusted his knees I asked him if he was praying. He nodded and said he was
    Christian. I told him I had seen the verse he had written in the bunk room.
    He spread peanut butter on a slice of bread and gave it to me. The inmates
    were allowed to pay the immigration officials to buy food for them. It was
    with Adnan his third week in the detention center.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “In my country this is jail,” he said. “In my country I am a good man. For
    me this is jail. I have never even been to jail, but this is jail for me.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    He told me that some of his friends and extended family were in New York.
    He had seen photos of them online about how they lived now. He said he
    wouldn’t live like them. He said he would save up all his money and send it
    back to his wife and children.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “But she plays games with me, man. She plays games with me.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Then the guy started to cry into his hands. I didn’t know what to do. All I
    could do was look at him.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Magdial told me that when he saw my legs he thought I had been tortured,
    that I was Yakuza, which made me feel pretty good. He told me to pile two
    of the thin mattresses on the bunk because sleeping with only one would
    make you feel the metal bars underneath.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    There was one woman whose name I never learned. She slept alone in the
    female quarters. She had a mohawk, not the spiky kind, but a thick strip
    that ended in a mullet. On the whiteboard in the yard she drew fake Chinese
    symbols, skull-and-crossbones, and the word “revolucion” over and over. At
    night we heard her howl and curse in Spanish. Some of the men shouted back.
    <em>Shut the fuck up, crazy bitch</em>. But no one knew why she was here, and we
    were afraid of her.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    In the yard we played rummy and ate lunch. It was always some form of rice
    and beans, and it was better than I had been eating the past couple months.
    The woman approached me and said that she was a doctor who could treat the
    cuts on my thighs. She placed her hands on my calves. I told her I was
    okay.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Don't let her touch you, dude,” Magdial whispered to me. “It was drugs.
    Drugs made her into a crazy bitch.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    The white cream had attracted gray dust and combined with my brown blood
    into a dry gravy that flaked off my thighs. Adnan and Magdial told me I
    needed to see a doctor. But I knew it wasn’t serious. There were many cuts,
    but none of them were deep or swollen. I carefully rinsed them in the
    dribbling shower each day and in the afternoon I lay in the sun to dry
    them.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    There was a small television in the room. The men were fixed on it. They
    stared at the pop stars dispatching villains in their music videos,
    celebrities sharing self-effacing anecdotes to adoring hosts and audiences,
    chefs adding handsome vegetables to blenders.

    I tried to read a little. They wouldn’t let us bring our things in, but
    they let me bring in a book when I flipped through the pages for them and
    showed them there was nothing inside. I got in my bunk and lay there trying
    to read the first page. Magdial came over on his way to the bathroom and
    looked at the cover.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “The Brothers Karamazov?” He said. He said it like a real Russian would.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Yeah.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    He was really excited and said it was his favorite book and that he’d been
    meaning to read it again.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “There’s so much soul in him, man. If you want soul, all you need is
    Dostoesvky,” he said. “‘God and the devil rage, man, and their battlefield
    is the hearts of man.’ You know?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Yeah.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    It was my last day in the center, and I figured I’d never get around to
    reading the book anyway, so I gave it to him. He was really happy, like I’d
    just given him a hundred bucks. One of the Bangladeshis was lying in bed
    with a cigarette. I offered him some change for one, but he said it was
    okay. We smoked as we lay in our bunks. There were no more good stories to
    tell one another. The ceiling fan clicked and took the smoke away. There
    were the squeals of our droopy spring mattresses, the soft pound of chalky
    feet on the blasted concrete, the traffic beyond, and the clean metronomic
    clucks of ping pong in the yard. Murmurs in Spanish, Hindi, Arabic, and
    Somali blended low. I wrote and rewrote lists and drew and redrew calendars
    of what I was going to do with the next two years of my life. One thing I
    was doing while I was waiting for rides was sketching these plans for a log
    cabin. Just having my own home and not depending on anyone else sounded
    really good to me. I was thinking next summer I'd go to Alaska where my
    friend John was. I met him when I worked during the winter at a ranch in
    northern California. I'd walk the docks every morning and ask for a job on
    a salmon boat. If I couldn’t get one I'd gut fish in a cannery for a
    season. When I had enough money I’d go buy land in the Cascades. I heard
    that besides Alaska, that mountain range is the least developed region in
    America. Maybe I'd just hike into the woods until I found a spot. This
    country's big enough that no one would ever come upon a small cabin. I'd
    build one by a stream I could use for cooking and drinking. I’d get the
    right tools and learn how to use them. I’d get a book on the local flora
    and fauna and forage for berries and mushrooms and fish and hunt small game
    and cook it on a wood stove. The stove would warm the cabin, too, and I
    would be warm in my sleeping bag at night. I would bring all my books and
    make a big bookshelf for them, too. Then I'd play my guitar, finish
    <em>Karamazov</em> and <em>Anna Karenina</em> and all those other big books you want to have
    read.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    So much damn noise, man, everywhere. There’s the everlasting freeway
    sounding like a wave that never breaks, just keeps gathering and gathering.
    The gardeners that come every Monday and the whole damn power grid—maybe
    I’m crazy, but there’s a white noise everywhere you go. Before all these
    new space-age TVs, you had those box TVs. CRT’s, they’re called. Wherever
    you were in your home, you knew when it was on because you’d hear this
    faint squeal, like there was a box of baby rats somewhere within your
    walls. I used to think I had this superpower because I was the only one in
    my family who could hear it, but I read that adults lose the ability to
    hear certain frequencies.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    But more than all the physical noise, there’s the mind’s noise, too.
    There’s the noise from your dick, the noise from the internet, which is
    probably the world’s shittiest friend. There's the benevolent tyranny of
    your mother, all the ways you're thinking of making a pretty girls yours,
    all the porn.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    So I'm going to get rid of it all. I figured out what my problem is: I got
    no inner world. I’m all outer-world-facing. I'm living like you do when
    it's a Friday night and you're about to go out with your friends. You can't
    get anything done because all you're thinking about is how the night's
    going to be. There’s nothing solid about me. I'm all dream, all potential,
    all idea, all desire. It's this damn noise.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Growing up, I loved tales like Robinson Crusoe. Guy shipwrecked on a
    tropical island, explores it and finds all this fruit, goats, turtles. He
    digs deep into a cave to make a home for himself and starts farming corn,
    wheat, barley. Another story I loved: <em>My Side of the Mountain</em>. This kid
    from NYC named Sam Gribley hitchhikes to the Catskills and burns out a
    rotted hemlock to make his home inside. He makes his own hooks for trout,
    eats turtles and uses the shells as bowls, sets rabbits traps. Wild onions,
    rice, garlic, various roots and tubers, strawberries, apples, blueberries,
    raspberries. What a life, really. Makes a fireplace out of the river clay
    in his hemlock, and nabs a baby duck hawk from its nest. Calls her
    Frightful, and she hunts game for them. Come hunting season, he nabs a
    couple deer that the hunters shot but couldn't find and makes himself a
    full buckskin suit. He probably lasts a good year in those mountains. I
    remember this one part where it's the wintertime, and he's stockpiled dried
    goods for himself—but he hasn't got any vegetables. So one day, feeling
    weak, he catches a rabbits and feels this strange urge to eat its liver.
    Turns out the liver's got a bunch of Vitamin C, which was exactly what he
    was missing.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Last story I loved as kid before I get to the point of what I'm trying to
    say: <em>The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar</em>. This book's by Roald Dahl, who
    wrote <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em>. He was probably my favorite writer
    as a kid, and every day I'd go to the library to see if he had any new
    books out. He didn't, though, because he was long dead. Anyway, Henry
    Sugar's a rich English kid who's full of shit, like one time he and his
    rich friends have a tortoise race at some lord's house, and they all place
    bets. Henry feeds sleeping pills to all the other tortoises so his can win.
    One day he finds this flimsy little book in his fancy library. It's called
    <em>A Report On An Interview With Imhrat Khan</em>, The Man Who Could See Without
    His Eyes. Written by this English doctor in India who's working in his
    office one day when this guy, Imhrat Khan, comes in and asks him for a
    favor. He's about to perform at a circus as "The Man Who Can See Without
    His Eyes," and he needs a doctor to wrap his head up in gauze and plaster.
    Doctor's intrigued and goes to see him perform at the circus. Khan, with
    his head all wrapped up, shoots guns and throws knives at people without
    ever hitting them. Crowd's wild. Doctor comes to see him after the show and
    asks him if he can interview him. So Khan tells him his life story: he was
    a poor boy who made some money learning from a magician. He gets good at
    that, but he wants to do real magic and sets out to find this yogi whom he
    hears can levitate. Takes him a lot of time and money to find him, deep in
    the middle of a forest, until finally he succeeds. He sees the man levitate
    and asks him how he can learn this power. Yogi gives him breathing
    exercises, tells him he has to control his conscious mind.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Khan asks him why.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Because,” Yogi says, “each man has two minds, the conscious and the
    subconscious. The subconscious mind is highly concentrated, but the
    conscious mind, the one everyone uses, is a scattered, unconcentrated
    thing. It is concerning itself with thousands of different items, the
    things you are seeing around you and the things you are thinking about. So
    you must learn to concentrate it in such a way that you can visualize at
    will one item, one item only, and absolutely nothing else. If you work hard
    at this, you should be able to concentrate your mind, your conscious mind,
    upon any one object you select for at least three and a half minutes. But
    that will take about fifteen years.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Fifteen years!” Khan cries.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    But he practices every day for hours, focusing on one object on a time,
    like on the faces of people he loves. He also spends every evening looking
    at a candle flame. Every flame's got three parts, he says, “The yellow at
    the top, the mauve lower down, and the black right inside.” Years later,
    he's able to walk on fire and focus on a single object for three minutes.
    Eventually, he's able to make out objects in front of him when his eyes are
    closed, reading closed books and playing cards that are facedown. Khan dies
    suddenly, because apparently that's what happens when you show off with
    your powers.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    That's the end, and Henry Sugar decides he's going to do the same thing.
    Holes himself up for years with a candle before heading out to a casino.
    Takes him four seconds to read a card that's lying face down, and he wins a
    ton of money. But as he's walking through the casino, after three years of
    meditation, he realizes he's changed. He doesn't care about all the wealth
    there like he used to. So he ends up travelling the world, ripping off
    casino after casino and giving all the money to orphanages.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Alright, so the point I want to make with these three books I loved as a
    kid is that they're all forgetting one big part about living: the how and
    the why. How do you spend a year in the mountains without feeling lonely?
    How do you spend three years looking at a candle without missing alcohol
    and girls? How do you go from last man to overman? Why? Isn't that what all
    our self-help books are trying to answer for us, all the motivational
    videos you find online about how today's the beginning of the rest of your
    life and one step at a time and all that bullshit? Your guy, Nietzsche: "He
    who has a why to live can bear almost any how." Man, what's the ‘why’
    today? Getting ripped? Getting a pretty girl to pick you? Young Gribley had
    it right, just like old Solomon: "Nothing is better for a man than that he
    should eat and drink, and that his soul should enjoy good in his labor."
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I want to tell you about my one Gribley experience. Toward the end of my
    journey, sometime in April, I worked on an island in Panama. One day the
    men left for mainland for some tools, and I stayed behind. I felt that
    excitement like when you have a big house to yourself. That night I made a
    fire on the east side of the island near the stucco frame house. I set up
    my pad by it and lay down. I wrote a little by the fire and listened to the
    waves below. They rasped when the tide sucked them in and sprayed upon the
    rock walls of the cliff. When I was little before I went to sleep I’d have
    these images of being on a lifeboat on the slope of a wave that was
    gathering itself hundreds of feet into the air. The thought of waiting to
    die like that terrified me and I’d lay pinned to my bed.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I felt something touch my sleeping bag. It was a blue crab about the size
    of my hand. It had those beady snail eyes. I got a saucepan from the house
    and trapped the crab beneath it. Then I used a spatula to scrape the crab
    into the pan. I poured oil on the pan and held it over the fire. The oil
    began to spit out of the pan, and the crab became a violent shiny red with
    blue-gray still on its edges and legs. I broke it apart with a rock and
    pulled out the soft white meat. It was sweet, salty, and moist, and good
    because you had to work for it and because there was so little.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    It was a small island on the Pacific coast of Panama. You could make a loop
    around the whole thing in an hour. It rose about twenty feet from the
    ocean, and a strip of white beach framed it like a moat. It was covered in
    dry jungle, except where it had been cleared, and was somewhere between
    tropical and Mediterranean in vegetation and climate. It had the laziness
    of coastal Spain or Greece in its dryness and sunlight, but in May the rain
    began, and every day we had an afternoon shower. There were two dark and
    big avocado trees in the center of the island, close to the main hut. They
    were at least thirty feet high, and their leaves were purple and leathery.
    Hundreds of avocados in a tree like black jewels, big avocados like the
    ones they have in supermarkets. One of the trees bore fruit with darker,
    purple-green shells and it was creamier and softer than the fruit of the
    other tree, whose shells were smooth and green like zucchini and whose
    fruit was unripe. Scattered about the island were also four or five papaya
    trees. The trees were thin and only had a few leaves, and if you gave them
    time they swelled with a single melon-sized fruit that looked too heavy for
    its thin trunk, like a slender woman who’s big with child. They were unripe
    if they were green and the same powdery color as their big star-shaped
    leaves, but when they became orange or yellow you tapped the fruit with a
    long pole so that it swayed and the weak stem gave. You had to catch the
    melon in your shirt and bring it quickly away from you to cradle it like a
    lacrosse stick or it would burst when it hit the ground. When you split the
    fruit there was the faint smell of bile, and its round black seeds gave you
    the feeling that they were swarming insects. But after you scraped them off
    you had the soft pink-red fruit whose belly was serrated and crystalline
    with sugar. The fruit was soft enough that it fell apart between your
    tongue and the roof of your mouth and went down like a sweet liquid. There
    was also an array of pineapple bushes but they were too young to bear
    fruit, and there was a plantain grove whose trees were like stalks and
    under whose palm fronds were the green or yellow tooth-like rows of
    bananas. But they were thicker than bananas and tasted like their tart, dry
    ends until you fried them with oil and sugar. Then they softened and were
    filling like meat.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    In the forest the leaves covered the ground so thickly that your feet sank
    to the shin as if you were stepping in snow. When you cleared them away the
    bottommost leaves were disintegrated, only gray stems and veins like a fish
    plucked clean, and the soil was black and moist like spent coffee grounds
    and every fistful of earth flashed and squirmed with insects in your palm.
    I thought about the island coming out of the ocean as cooling magma, then
    the first bird dropping seeds on it, and now it was covered with life and
    deep with it, too. And everything growing out of the remains of everything
    that died on it. I thought about how it was possible for the island to get
    more and more life and matter, and I’m thinking that it’s the work of
    millions of small birds over the course of hundreds of thousands, maybe
    millions of years. Seeds in their poop, insects for their young, fish and
    crabs coming ashore, rain every afternoon, a handful of life arriving every
    day to the island.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    A stout, dark-skinned man named Tony owned the island. One of his calves
    was heavily scarred, nearly carved out. It was hairless from the scarring,
    and knotted and shiny like a piece of polished wood. He dragged it behind
    him. But his eyes were kind, black and glittering like you always had an
    inside joke with him. He and two brothers were slowly transforming the
    island into a surfers’ hostel. I worked for six weeks under another man, an
    American named Richard, a tan and wiry man of 62 years with a dark hairy
    chest. Some part of his face or one of his limbs was always twitching, and
    he was always scowling. So it was five men on that island, including me.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Every morning I got the same frayed rice sack from the main sack and went
    around the island picking fruit and collecting eggs. There were some
    groceries from the mainland like vegetables, pasta, rice, cooking oil, and
    spices. We cooked on a two-burner stove that was attached by a hose to a
    squat propane tank. We cooked with and drank from the rainwater that
    collected into a blue plastic garbage bin from the rain gutter of the main
    hut. The water tasted slightly metallic and alkaline. I drank it liberally.
    The two brothers fished often and would salt the perch and dry it out on
    the rock wall in front of the hut. The small cubes of rock salt looked
    tasty on the tan flesh that had in the sun shrunken beneath the spine and
    rib bones. The brothers spoke a quiet, mumbling Spanish that was incoherent
    to me and kept to themselves.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    The south side of the island had dozens of coconut trees. You could go
    around picking up coconuts and shaking them to see if they had juice. The
    glossy green ones sloshed with more juice than the grey-brown ones, but
    these were sweeter. I got good at that two-part machete strike that would
    create a wedge into the shell for me to drink its juice. I shook the juice
    out into a bowl, then I split the shell with an overhead machete strike and
    carved out the hard white meat with a spoon. Ants swarmed under me and bit
    my bare feet as juice and slivers of fruit ran down my front, and I would
    rub my feet over each other to alleviate the sting.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    To wash I would go into the ocean and rub sand into my skin and hair. The
    water was warm and shallow, the clear aqua that flashes with sunlight and
    means paradise. Then I would walk back up the carved stairs to the hut and
    rinse the salt off my skin with bowls of rainwater from the blue bin.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Sometimes I went for a swim in the ocean. You could go far out because on
    the north side of the island where the skiff was moored, the waves were
    waist-high. But I wouldn’t go too far. The shallowness continued for some
    time before it dropped off suddenly into a wasteland of powdery-gray
    detritus and narrow brown fish that picked at it. They darted when your
    shadow was on them. The gray pillowy floor was bare except for the fish,
    rocks, and brown seaweed about a foot high. The floor had a strange
    consistency, soft like river silt, but airy so that you could dig your hand
    deep into it, though it took me a lot of courage to do that. The sunlight
    was geometric here and cut cleanly toward the floor like prisms from the
    surface, which here were the heavens themselves. At this depth the weight
    of the ocean pressed on you and gave you the sharp pain in your ears. The
    fear was there too, the prey feeling. Darkened the mind and the edges of
    your vision, made you think there was a shark or a barracuda coming at you
    in your blind spots.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Tony had me restore the walkway to the frond-thatched hut, to dust and
    remove detritus from the stone-carved staircase up the cliff. There was a
    mound of about 100 clear glass bottles of Panamanian rum in the woods, and
    he wanted me to plant them bottom-up on the path between the hut and the
    hostel which was at the time only a two-bedroom stucco frame. The hut and
    the hostel were about a half-mile apart, which was about the length of the
    island. After soaking them in soapy water I scraped off their labels with
    steel wool and gouged out the earth with a spade to plant them. Sometimes I
    took things like a generator or a small refrigerator by wheelbarrow between
    the hut and the hostel. The men were older than me and got tired quickly.
    They were digging a well on the east end of the island where the hostel
    was.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Tony had a boy who had first come onto the island with me. We had picked
    him up from school and drove through the night to the beach where the skiff
    was moored. We drove in a pick-up truck with three seats in the front, and
    the boy whose name wasn’t Spanish but something long and indigenous, was
    sullen with me. Then some time later he decided that he liked me and he
    would shout my name whenever he arrived on the island. He would strip down
    to his white underwear and would stay like that until he left the island
    again He followed Tony or me around and would help me with my chores. There
    was a battered and flat ball in the hut, and we kicked it around. Sometimes
    when I walked the edge of the cliff I saw him swimming in the ocean. He
    showed me with a knife how to peel the green skin off the sugar cane and
    and bite it with the molars to release the juice and to suck on it until
    only the stringy pulp remained. He was confident with the knife and the
    machete that he brought down in one clean motion to cleave the cane off so
    that it was like an organ pipe, and he smiled as he sucked on his end of
    the cane. He was good and happy and he loved his father, and I avoided him.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Richard helped me put together a shelter on my first week on the island, on
    the cliff of one of the northern points of the island. We carried a long
    bamboo rod to the site where it acted as a tarp pole. He let me borrow his
    tent, which I patched with duct tape. Richard had plotted out some land on
    the east side of the island where he was going to build a home. I offered
    to help him with it. We spent a few hours that day beach combing on the
    east and west sides of the island, collecting sea glass, uncracked shells,
    and polished pieces of driftwood. There were sizzling tufts of yellow sea
    foam and wobbly knobs of jellyfish pierced with sunlight. There were tire
    shavings, bottles of plastic and polished glass. The glass was dark amber,
    medicine blue, clear, and frosted, and there were the frayed remains of
    webbed lawn chairs, shoes, blue netting, aluminum cans, and rusty pieces of
    metal.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Richard and I met every half-hour to show each other what we had found. We
    spent most of our time at a distance with our attention at our feet and our
    eyes attracted toward any strange and man-made colors, shapes, and
    patterns. He was looking for the other mate of a pair of sandals. I
    returned all that I found to the sand in a small pile and looked with him.
    It occurred to me that we wouldn’t find pairs of any kind on this beach.
    But eventually I found an off-brand sandal for him that was the same size.
    We walked ankle-deep toward a smaller beach that could only be reached in
    the low tide. He said that everything we needed could be found on the
    shores of remote islands near America and that we didn’t need to make
    anything anymore, except for food.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    The latter half of that April I spent shirtless and became as brown as the
    other men. Mosquito bites came and went on my back. My scars became raised
    white lines across my thighs. They looked like I had done them to myself,
    and I remember that’s what you thought in the car on our way to Joshua
    Tree. At night after dinner and after the mosquitoes had left the stillness
    of the sunset I wrote and read by candlelight while the men rolled
    cigarettes and drank by the main hut. One night I was writing inside my
    tent. It felt good to be inside the mesh. I gotta tell you that there
    during the first half of my trip, especially in Mexico, my arms and ankles
    were always covered with mosquito bites. At night the heat of my sleeping
    bag would sort of radiate onto my bites, activate them. Half-asleep and
    half-crazed in the pleasure of it I raked my weeping skin until I bled, and
    in the morning my fingernails would be stuffed black with blood and skin
    and smell metallic. But here I was really grateful and cozy to be inside
    the mesh where the mosquitoes couldn’t get to me and a tarp over me to keep
    me dry. I’d cut the top off a plastic soda bottle and put a candle inside.
    I used some of its hot wax to hold it in place. Richard came by my tent and
    sat cross-legged in front of me. I saw through the mesh that he had a
    bottle of that white rum.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Hey man,” he said. “If you want we could build you a house, too. Right
    here. 12 by 12 by ... 10, or 12. Whatever you want. When the surfer hostel
    gets going we can go to mainland and advertise, bring ‘em back here and get
    some commission ... I’m thinking a lofted bed, could get you a propane tank
    and a stove. Make your morning coffee and look out at that.” He gestured to
    the ocean. “Think about it, think about it. La Isla de what?” He smiled
    big. “De Afuera!” And he backhanded the air. “Afuera!”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I laughed and told him we could get started soon. He wanted to talk more,
    but I told him I was going to bed. He left, and I lay in my sleeping bag
    for some time.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    On my computer was a video of Alex and me on a beach in Fort Bragg,
    California. We spent a weekend there at a bed and breakfast after I had
    worked there during the winter break of my sophomore year. One morning we
    walked a few miles along the sea cliffs. We crossed a long wooden bridge
    between two cliffs which lay over a shallow murky lake that carried into
    the ocean. There was a policeman wading slowly toward something under the
    bridge, and we leaned over the rail to see what it was. It was a dead man
    floating on his back.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    The beaches of Northern California are not like the ones in Southern
    California. They’re narrow and above them are wet and rocky cliffs and rock
    formations you climb down to get to the beaches. On the cliffs are meadows
    of green grass and wildflowers, and there are also tall, skinny trees that
    are bedheaded from the cold sea winds and gesture inland. The water is the
    kind that you only go in to show that you’re a man. The waves have bored
    holes in some of the outcroppings of wet black rock and have made arches
    and islands. Some of the islands are flat and have fresh grass and
    wildflowers upon them. At first you think there’s also trash on these
    islands, and you wonder how someone had swam and scaled its walls which are
    20 feet high. But then you see a lot of seagulls with red dipped on their
    yellow beak tips coming back and forth toward the island like it’s a
    beached, dead whale, and you realize that it isn’t trash. It’s the black
    and white downy feathers of their young. You want to climb onto the island
    and lie on the grass because you know that no one else has ever been there.
    On the beaches are dark green and rubbery kelp, hollow yellow-brown bulbs,
    white driftwood, and the fishy decay of jellyfish and seashells. When the
    tide ebbs, the water sizzles and bubbles over the coarse sand like spit on
    the mouth of a crab, and the rounded glass and pebbles crunch underfoot,
    such as when you dig your hand into a jar of marbles.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    She is running ahead of me, dancing just beyond the last unfoldings of
    waves along the sand.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “No rules,” she says. “No rules!”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    She is wearing a black hoodie with a white zipper, blue jeans, and gray
    Converse sneakers. She is wearing her black-framed glasses that are big for
    her face. Her black hair is rich and mane-like and begins at her widow’s
    peak and reaches the middle of her back. I have spent many nights with my
    nose in its roots. An old pair of leather binoculars from the inn hang from
    her neck, as they do on mine. They are heavy and cloudy, and we have
    brought them for show. I am laughing as I record her, thinking about how we
    will watch this video in the future after we have spent many years away
    from each other, after we realize that in spite of having met when we were
    so young, we hadn’t yet met anyone like the other.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I don’t think you’re taking advantage of ‘No Rules,’” she says.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Then she lopes sideways towards me to avoid the lens. I lower it and we
    embrace.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    What a photo or a video can do is anchor a memory, like a historical fact.
    It can keep it from wear or corruption. And when you look at it after many
    years, after the bramble of memory has obscured it, the truth emerges. We
    should be suspicious of our memories because I read that every act of
    remembrance alters the memory itself, like a game of telephone. But a
    memory feeds on remembrance, so either way it’s doomed.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    That video of Alex on the beach is gone now. Before leaving for my trip I
    erased it from my computer because I wanted to feel something. I did, I
    felt a stupid kind of loss. And now she’s leaving my head, losing
    dimension. That makes me kind of sad. But grateful too, that a memory has a
    half-life, but that the way she made me feel will live as long as I do.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    There’s a photo from that weekend, too. We’re in our room in the old water
    tower. She’s sitting like The Thinker, but she’s leaning back in her chair.
    On the table before her are two fat wine glasses filled with white wine, a
    harmonica, and a basil jar of bush weed I had gotten from Steve, the inn’s
    maintenance man. One of her arms is across her belly, and her fist is up to
    her chin. Her bra is black and her underwear is pink. If I were to slip
    that photo in these pages, right here, so that as you opened to it you saw
    the defensiveness in her dark eyes and the nonchalance in her limbs, the
    pale skin of her thighs, then it goes without saying that you would pass
    over my description in favor of the photo itself. She’d come alive to you.
    I’m looking at that photo on my desk right now. Makes me think: Yes, that
    is what it was like.

<p dir="ltr">
    I REMEMBER IN HIGH SCHOOL once when we were working on the newspaper. She
    came in to deliver some photos of hers. It was a Saturday morning. She had
    just come back from the beach with her friends. She was wearing a
    spring-green dress, and she glowed in the shy and generous way that a girl
    does when she considers that she might be beautiful. I looked and looked at
    her from behind my computer.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I remember the way she was looking at me at that party in the summer after
    high school. I was drunk for the first time in my life, and only had on my
    friend’s swim trunks which were very big on me. She was looking at me like
    I was good, like I was what she was looking for. But there was something
    deeper there, too. It was like she was looking just a little bit beyond me.
    There was something sad and out-of-focus about her eyes that didn’t have to
    do with me. I didn’t know that at the time, but now I do.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I remember she told me that her mom went through depression when she was
    little. One day her mom’s grandmother died and she saw her mom crying by
    her bed. She went to her and cried with her. She was two then, and her mom
    told her that story years later when she could understand.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I remember her dad once told her that he was going to run an errand, and
    she asked him if she could go along. I'm not sure how old she was. Three,
    four, five. She ended up looking at an apartment with him, and it wasn’t
    until she was older that she realized how close her parents' marriage was
    to coming undone.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I know that her sister and her mom used to fight a lot, and I know she
    doesn’t raise her voice to anyone.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I remember when we’d talk for hours almost every night after that party,
    and I remember how there was nothing but the next thing she was going to
    say. It’s 11:11, she said once. Make a wish.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I told her I wished that I’d taken her to Senior Ball when she’d asked me.
    I asked her what she wished for. She said she wished things were different.
    But she couldn't say why.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    One time my sophomore year I got two free tickets from one of my classes to
    see a reading of two writers in San Francisco. We drank before, on the way,
    during, and I loved her that night. When we got there she told me she
    needed to pee so we both stumbled into the bathroom. I’m peeing in front of
    you, she said, and I supposed she’d never done that before and I loved her
    that night.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We passed that bottle of vodka and juice back and forth as we sat in the
    back. She always drank better than me. The gray-haired moderator was
    talking about how their books had really similar themes even though they
    were super different. I turned to her and whispered he’s just <em>jacking them
    off</em> and I motioned like I was giving her a handjob and she tilted her head
    back and groaned throatily and we laughed. She was always quick like that.
    On our way to the station she said <em>Brian</em>. Then she looked around and opened
    her jacket. She was wearing an oversized bomber jacket over a seafoam-green
    strapless dress, and she whispered <em>remember how I told you I was having
    problems with my dress</em> and she opened it. Not seductively, but like a kid
    to a kid, and her boobs were peering out from over the cups of her dress.
    Right on the corner of Van Ness and something. I told her I didn’t see what
    the problem was and pretended to reach for them like a zombie and she
    laughed.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    While we were waiting for the train to take us home I remember that she
    looked at me in this almost complete adoration. I felt unfit for that look.
    So I looked away. I asked her how her legs were doing in the cold, one
    ankle up, en pointe and pestling into the ground like she needed to pee.
    She said she just being a little jittery and she looked at me again with
    that look but it was sheepish, too. I realized that she thought I had asked
    her what are you doing so I said <em>no, I meant how are you doing, it’s so
    cold</em> and she said <em>ohh</em> and her sheepishness went away and she said <em>nuuthing</em>
    and it was that look again, and I had to look away again.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    And I remember the last time I saw her too, couple months after all this,
    after we’d parted. She was home for Christmas, and she hit me up. I was
    living at my parents’, and she picked me up and we talked the whole night.
    Made love. Hung out again a couple days later. It wasn’t the same. I
    thought it was so strange that you could do the same things with another
    person that you did a couple years back when you loved each other, but feel
    like this time you were with a stranger.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I remember when she dropped me off she wouldn’t turn her car off. She
    started to cry silently, and I heard her tears thud on my windbreaker. I
    asked her in the wrong voice why she was crying. She said it was for those
    times past that we could never get back, and I went home and hit my desk
    and also cried. A couple months later I decided to go and see her in
    Seattle. I hitchhiked there from Big Sur. Got a really bad case of poison
    oak all over my body trying to bushwhack my way through the overgrown
    trail, spent the coldest night of my life on the Lost Coast Trail after I
    fell into a river, and got a ride with a bunch of hippies up to Arcata.
    Spend a day hitching up to Eugene with an old guy named Jimmy who looked
    like Fidel Castro. We slept in the stall of a bathroom at a rest stop that
    night because it was so cold outside. Then it was a straight shot from
    Portland to Seattle, and I got a bus to her place. We walked around this
    big green lake by her house. She said that sometimes you could see orcas
    surface in it. I told her that it was like we lived in different worlds,
    and she laughed. It was the morning, but we brown-bagged a couple 40s and
    drank on a park bench. We went with her friends to a bar that night and
    played pool. I remember her best friend saying, I never know what’s really
    going on with her. Me too, I said. We spent the night on the couch of her
    friend. My face was on her chest. I asked her if she wanted to get back
    together and closed my eyes. I felt her chest rise and fall. No.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    You’re my favorite, she whispered. That made me cry, and she kissed me
    around my face. Then she left, before it was even light out, and I never
    saw her again.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    TOWARD THE END of my stay once we took the skiff to mainland. Richard
    wanted to catch up with some of his friends. I also knew he wanted to get
    laid. His battered green jeep was by the dock. We drove for about a half
    hour down the coast to his house with cans of beer in our laps. We followed
    a gravel road through a neighborhood of large houses, most of which he said
    belonged to American expatriates. Richard told me how the owners of these
    homes had made their money.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “This guy started breeding, like, short, squat coconut trees so you can
    pick the nuts easier. Rolling in it now.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Hotels, man. Resorts all up and down the coast. Chiriqui, Boca Negra and
    shit.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We passed by a panadería, whose owner stared at Richard as we drove by.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “She and I had a long conversation in the hopes of reconciliation,” he
    said. “And we came to the conclusion that she was a sour cunt.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We entered dirt roads among fields and modest houses with peeling paint and
    overgrown yards. The houses were different pastel colors, and palm fronds
    lay over the wet dirt roads. Altogether it was a pleasant and clean
    neighborhood, and it had that lightness that belongs to neighborhoods that
    are poor but rich in community. The elderly sat on their porches, their
    mouths pinched, wood-carved, and the delighted cries of children could be
    heard as commonly as those of the tropical birds. We passed by a small dirt
    soccer field with wooden beams tied with rope for goalposts. We pulled into
    a gravel driveway. Richard crushed his third can in his fist and burped.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “It’s light stuff,” he said. “Literally cannot fuck you up.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    His small two-room house had bats. They fluttered like jagged pieces of
    black cloth that changed in size as they moved from rafter to rafter. They
    blocked the light and put shadows on the wall. His home had the earthy and
    urine-like odor of bat feces, and the linens on the bed he let me sleep on
    were dusted with it. His bathroom had black mold in the corners. The toilet
    seat had a broken hinge and was yellowed and peeling, and the hole in the
    wall of the shower was plugged with a green soda bottle that let in a
    fractured green light. What appeared to be soil, but what I later realized
    were the feces, was scattered on the concrete floor. Molding dishes covered
    in these feces filled his sink, all of his kitchen’s countertops, and the
    floor around. I spent a few hours cleaning his kitchen while Richard
    visited his friends. My pruny hands glowed with heat from the harsh soap.
    After I finished I walked around the neighborhood hoping to find a pick-up
    game of soccer. But there was nothing going on, and I spent a few hours
    walking along the beach sand which was soft with yellowed palm fronds.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Before I went to bed I put on a long-sleeved shirt and pants within my
    sleeping bag and slept with my hood on because I was afraid a bat might
    bite me.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Around midnight he told me to come with him to the local bar on the beach.
    I came, even though I knew he only wanted me to so I help him get a girl.
    He was already drunk, and he wanted to drive there. I told him I would walk
    there myself. Fine, he said. Then he drove into a ditch just ahead of me.
    We walked together. There were a few local men at the bar. They were
    grinning at the two women there. They crooned to the music and shuffled
    their feet. Richard brought me over to the younger of the women.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “El es muy inteligente,” he shouted over the music.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    She smiled politely at me.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I left and went to bed.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Hours later I heard the front door open.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Brian!’ Richard shouted. “We have guests!”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I ignored him and went back to sleep with earplugs.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    In the morning there was broken glass on his porch. The outdoor table was
    shattered, and there was blood smeared on the ground. Richard was smoking
    on a chair.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “What happened?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    He took a long drag and flicked the butt onto the grass. “Brought back some
    friends from the bar, guy and a girl. Girl would only come on condition
    that the guy would, so fuck it, we all came back here. You were knocked
    out. Go back to my room and start up a porno in my bed. Missionary, doggy
    shit. Nothing fucked up. Everything’s going swell until the man starts
    groping the woman. Grabbing her tits, pinching her ass, pulling her hair.
    ‘Puta, Puta.’ So I grab the fucker by the seat of his pants and drag him
    outside. Put his face through the glass table and stomp on his head a
    couple times to put some sense in him.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Where is he now?
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Took off like a bitch. Left some teeth, too. Man. Mood dead, girl gone.
    Didn’t even get to fuck her!”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    When he asked me for help in jacking his car out of the ditch, I told him
    that since he had gotten himself into that ditch, he should be the one to
    get himself out of it. He stared at me. Then he quietly resumed his work.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I read on his porch for a bit then left to visit Richard’s friend, Chuck, a
    Texan expatriate, to see if I could use his internet connection. When I
    returned to Richard’s after the sun had gone down I found that the front
    door was locked. So I set up camp on his porch and waited for him to come.
    When he did late into the night I greeted him.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “You cocksucker,” he said. “You think you can just leave, like just fucking
    get up and go? Well, what the <em>fuck</em> am I supposed to do—am I just supposed
    to carry on with my fucking day? I hired you to work for me, motherfucker,
    you're <em>mine</em>, you're supposed to be at my every beck and <em>call</em>, motherfucker.
    You probably had your mom make your bed for you every morning, you
    freeloading motherfucker. You never worked a goddamn day in your life, you
    fucking kid, you selfish fuck, you're only thinking about yourself, that's
    all you ever fucking do—how do I promote myself, how do I manipulate people
    to like me—you'll be successful but you'll be so fucking alone because no
    one wants to be around selfish pricks like you and you think you're so
    fucking smart but guess what, motherfucker—<em>I'm smarter than you</em>—I've been
    around for forty fucking years longer than you and you're a dumb
    motherfucker. You didn’t even know what the fuck was going when we almost
    died on that boat! I saw you, you fucking fool, you were out of your
    fucking head on that boat!
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Your parents fucked up, your brother and your sister fucked up, and
    there's no fucking hope for you. If my kids ever acted like you I'd beat
    them into the fucking ground. At three, at three fucking years of age, my
    son and my daughter fucking outshined you, you disrespectful piece of shit.
    Don't you fucking judge me—yeah I know you fucking judge me, the way you
    look at me and the way you use your goddamn tone with me, I see you writing
    in your little fucking diary about me, you think I'm fucking a—a <em>drunk</em> and
    a <em>loser</em>—well you're a goddamn sociopath. You just stand there, you
    remorseless fucker—is anything I'm saying even reaching you? What did I do
    to you to make you hate me? Well, fuck you. <em>Fuck you</em>. You're never coming
    back to the island—all your stuff's gone, that shelter’s <em>mine</em> now—because I
    don't want you manipulating anyone, I don't want you near the clients 'cus
    you'll just manipulate your way into getting them to do whatever you want.
    I don't ever want to see you again. Ciao! <em>Ciao</em>!”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    We went back to the island the next day. Richard answered to Tony who had
    no problems with me. For the next three days I lived in a hell. On the
    skiff ride to the island Richard told me he would kill me if I tried to
    “fuck with Tony or with him.” I asked him if he was serious. Yeah, you dumb
    motherfucker. I worked as I normally did in the daytime, but I also
    sharpened a long branch into a spear and kept it by my new shelter, which I
    made in the forest on the island’s west side. I carried a few rocks in my
    pocket. I did push-ups, dips, sit-ups, and chin-ups off tree branches. At
    night under a leaking rain fly I had found in the hut, drops of water
    thudded on my forehead and mosquitoes went for my skin. I listened for him
    to come. If I have to kill him, I thought, I’ll kill him.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    The morning we left I went into his bag and among empty prescription
    bottles of lithium I found his passport. I was going to bury it or throw it
    off the island, but I decided not to. Instead I went into his journal, in
    which was written:
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <center>Locate saw near plot.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Begin staking land out.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Help Brian with shelter.</center>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    In his penmanship I wrote sporadically throughout the journal:
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
   <center>Where is my family?
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Where are my friends?
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Am I alone?
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Where has my memory gone?
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I am going to die alone, and no one will know that I did.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Out of lithium … think I’m going crazy …</center>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Then I went to the shelter on the cliff over the sea. I was going to rip
    apart his tarp and his tent with a knife, but I didn’t. I only threw the
    bamboo rod off the cliff. The tide was up to the steps on the cliff. The
    waves were foamy and yellow-gray. Tony kayaked to the anchored skiff to
    bring it closer to shore. He hovered it as closely as he could without
    scraping the rudder on the sand. Richard and I waded out toward them with
    our backpacks above our heads. We climbed with our elbows over the side of
    the boat. We motored a few miles over the sea toward the small bay. The low
    green trees grew up to the shore and the lake-waves lapped at their roots
    and trunks. Tony slowed the skiff when we entered an inlet. We hummed
    through the still water for a few more minutes. When we were close to the
    small beach that opened just a few feet to the road Tony killed the motor
    and motioned to me with the mooring line. We continued to move slowly
    toward the shore. I took off my shirt and my sandals and slid into the dark
    green water and swam with my head dry toward the beach. I felt with my toes
    a cold black current. I tasted my wet lips. It was freshwater. The boy dove
    in behind me with a shout. I hitched the line to the thick trunk of a tree
    whose branches hung over the water and began slowly to pull the boat toward
    me. The boy climbed the tree with his foot on the rope and leaped off it.
    He swam in the shadow of the tree and spat water out of his mouth. I wanted
    to tell him that this was the last time I would see him. Instead I got my
    things from the skiff and walked up the gravel beach onto the road and
    began south. Some rain had come, and the asphalt was moist and crunchy and
    had the bitter scent of wet soil. I had with me four big avocados from the
    good tree. They were dark and firm and gave like clay when you pressed into
    them. The air was new and cool, and I felt that brief virtue as you do when
    you begin on the road again after a long time. Then it was a matter of
    waiting for my flight. I spent a night in a large concrete pipe outside of
    a strip mall. It was a good place to sleep because one end was blocked by a
    perpendicular pipe. I lit a citronella candle I’d stolen to ward off
    mosquitoes. The light was alive on the walls of the pipe like fire on the
    wall of a cave. The next day I found a little wooden platform in a shed. It
    rained hard that night. The rain came heavily off the roof and splattered
    by me. Then I hitchhiked to a hostel on the Atlantic side of Panama to see
    if I could work there. The owner was an old American. He and his old
    stringy expat friends were jamming on the deck of the hostel. They were
    messed up and crooning “Hotel California.” The girl who worked there gave
    me some sheets and told me to take one of the bunks in the hostel. She was
    pretty with big brown eyes and spoke good English. At night as I lay in my
    bunk the old American shined his light in my direction and held it there
    for some time while he and the girl whispered. I kept my eyes closed. He
    was still drunk and breathing heavy. I wondered what kind of relationship
    he had with the girl. In the morning before anyone was awake I went back to
    Panama City. The young black man who gave me a ride there said I could
    sleep at his home. We got along well, but when we got to his place at night
    he went inside to talk to his mother. He said I could sleep outside their
    apartment. Next day I got a bus to the airport terminal. I found some cheap
    earbuds on the seat next to me. I went to the bathroom and sat on the
    toilet. Then I listened to a song and cried.
</p>
<br/>

    8.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    THERE WAS A BLACKOUT on campus that night so I went to check it out. Reason
    for it was that someone had stolen copper wire from some place outside
    campus, and that had somehow caused an explosion on campus. It came out of
    one of those steam vents. A man-sized fireball, I heard. I thought about
    all those rats going scree, scree, scree as they’re roasted alive. I looked
    it up and apparently the price of copper has been going up over the past
    couple years and that you could get a lot for that wire. What really
    interested me was the guy who orchestrated it all. I mean, who do you know
    who’s got the brains to monitor copper prices and find out where there’s a
    lot of it <em>and</em> got the balls to break the law like that? That’s a guy who
    likes life. I figured it was a good night to walk around campus because
    there would be nobody there and it’d be pitch black. I was wearing the same
    thing I was wearing the night before when I helped John out, just a hoodie
    and some jeans. I'm guessing your place feels different when there’s a blackout.
    I don’t know if the science backs it up, but when there’s no electricity,
    or maybe when you know there’s no electricity, it feels different. Feels
    calm, really calm, all the way to the bottom of your lungs like when you
    take a long drag. When I was little we had a community pool that I’d go
    down to at night with a piece of a plastic hose we used for the aquarium.
    I’d sit at the bottom of the pool and use the hose as a snorkel. I’d sit
    there and feel calm.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    A girl was coming toward me. She must have been there to check out the
    blackout, too. She was cute, with brown hair that came down to her
    shoulders. Her hair looked really soft and healthy, and you could see part
    of her ear through it. It kind of reminded me of that haircut girls had
    during the World Wars, English or French girls with berets and stockings
    and satchels running during an air raid. She was dressed in a nice way,
    too. Just a black t-shirt and tight black jeans that fit real well, and
    some red lipstick. She was wearing a black Casio that was facing inside.
    She had great legs and a great butt, too— she was small and tight like a
    soccer player or a gymnast—and she knew it, too, because her t-shirt was
    tucked in. It’s nice to see a girl who’s into clothes, but you can tell
    when that’s most of who she is. Too much production and you’re worried
    she’ll wilt throughout the day and be a different version of herself when
    she’s not made up. This girl looked like the kind who would know a lot
    about a certain kind of art, like photography or film. You could tell by
    her eyes, the way they were swimming, that she wouldn’t think lesser of you
    if you didn’t have a particular opinion on Godard or something. Like she
    was into art because it made her feel good, not because it made her look
    good.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    She’s coming my way and we both look at each other longer than usual
    because we know we got something in common. The way she looks at me, it’s
    with those kind of wide eyes where you know a girl is interested in you. I
    was probably giving her the same look, too, because she blushed a little,
    you know like when someone looks at your eyes for too long and you lose
    your composure. We both slowed down near each other, and I don’t know why
    but I just kept walking past her, even though we’d just pretty much just
    said that we were into each other. Moments like that, man, they hit you,
    they shake you. But I’ll tell you the reason I didn’t make a move, and
    that’s because a couple weeks ago I was at this party. It was Eric’s party.
    He was living at this new house with some cool people who were into the
    cutting edge of hip music, you know, the kind of people who have religious
    experiences listening to whole albums. They even had a name for their
    house, Carleton House, because that was the name of the street they were
    on. Anyway, first night I went over to them with a handle of rum, and I was
    my good self. Making good jokes, making people happy, not being excessive.
    That’s my problem: I make a good first impression. It’s the second and
    third where I always mess it up by going too far. For now, these guys were
    cool with me. One of them even told me that I had a “good handle over my
    drunk self.” But they were smart, too, of course. One of them was working
    with Stephen Hawking or something before he died. Anyway, they had this one
    friend with them named Marissa. Man, prettiest girl I’ve ever seen at Cal.
    So pretty that I already knew her face before I met her, and it was a good
    day when I saw her around on campus. Half-Japanese, like Alex. Kind of girl
    whose face you wouldn’t change a thing about. Everyone’s got a type, and
    she was it. And cool, too. She always looked like she had something
    important to do, like she had a really rich inner world. Anyway, they had
    this party one night, and I saw her in the kitchen. We got to talking. I
    don’t even remember what we talked about except that it was all jokes,
    nothing serious, and everything was hitting. Man, you know that feeling
    when you’re buzzed and talking to a great girl and making her laugh? Man,
    that was that night. During our conversation she even said: “Hey, I like
    you!” Not in a romantic way, but that I was <em>in</em>.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    But then this black guy came into the conversation, says hi and introduces
    himself. Marissa asks him where’s he from. Brooklyn, he says. Then she gets
    all shy like he’s just said he’s James Baldwin’s godson, and she asks him
    if he doesn’t mind her asking him about Brooklyn. The guy grins at me and
    they start a Q&amp;A about his damn city. This guy, man, he went to Harvard
    and was going to start law school at Boalt. I also knew that he was 30. So
    all the while he’s giving us this talk I’m thinking: this 30-year-old
    bastard, coming in and poaching at a college party. So I drank some more,
    figured the night wasn’t a total loss, and Eric walked me home.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Couple weeks later those guys had a Fourth of July party. It was just after
    Germany beat Brazil 7-1 in the World Cup semifinal, and I was walking back
    from Pappy’s to their place on Telegraph. That’s when I saw Marissa again,
    wearing red, white, and blue. I was thinking that today I was going to make
    my move. But I never got the chance because I was being a coward. What I
    was doing was looking at her every chance I got. I knew the way I was
    looking at her. Maybe you’ve seen girls look at you like that, too, like
    how they could give up everything and go live in your world, how you could
    save them till they died. She’d look at me, too, and look away. Couple days
    later I asked about her to Eric.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Oh, I didn’t tell you?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “What?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “She thinks you’re kinda creepy.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Damn, I thought. Damn.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    But I got another little confession to make, which is that one day I saw
    Marissa come out of Dwinelle. I noted the time and date—1:30, Tuesday—and
    figured she had the same class on Thursday. You know how the scheduling
    works here, Monday/Wednesday, Tuesday/Thursday. So I walked around inside
    Dwinelle, that maze. Damn, I even dressed up a little. Anyway, I’m walking
    downstairs, and there she is coming up. We both stop suddenly and stand
    there.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I have to go to class, she says.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Yeah.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    That’s what was in my head when I walked past the girl in black. But then I
    thought: That was a connection, wasn’t it? Yeah, it was. So I started
    running back to where that girl was. Running past VLSB and down onto that
    intersection on Oxford. Gone. Things like that, those missed connections,
    they haunt you for life. I turned back and started walking back up campus.
    All I could think about were her eyes and her ass and how I could have
    built my life around them.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Man, I was thinking about how there was no going back to just talking to a
    girl and not thinking about how she’d look on your arm. It was either yes
    or no and if it was yes than you got to start playing the game, and if no
    then you didn’t want to be around her. I’m thinking your friend’s dad was
    right when he said don’t get to fifty because then you can’t fall in love
    anymore. I’m thinking there’s a reason you and I would rather have
    daughters than sons, why in the movies you always got the cold-blooded guy
    who’s killed a lot of people and drinks a lot, and then a little girl comes
    his way and he ends up loving her and protecting her with his life. He
    always dies in the end because there’s no going back for him, no way he can
    unsee and undo everything. But the little girl, he can see that she’s still
    pure and good, and he’ll do anything to make sure she stays that way. I
    guess being boys, you know that getting messed up is just a matter of time
    because I’m telling you, sometimes I feel like a slave to it. Man, if
    someone told me he could take it away for good, I might just do it.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    That’s why I’m saying that if you get a kid, boy or girl, you got to take
    them away from the city and go to the mountains where there’s no internet.
    I’m serious. Make sure they don’t forget their definitions. I guess the
    most important thing is don’t have kids unless you have the right
    definitions, unless you love life. Be there for your kid, man, don’t leave
    him all burnt in the sun, and don’t say that you did all you could—if the
    kid’s alive then it’s not too late—and don’t make him hate his life so bad
    that he kills himself or anyone with him. Don’t leave your wife either—that
    promise is for life, not a couple years. Don’t leave her to kill herself,
    and don’t say that bullshit that you did all you could and the rest is on
    her now. I met a guy named Wesley who told me about how his ex-wife almost
    killed herself. They divorced because he cheated on her with one of his
    co-workers, and that destroyed her. Once he moved out she got really
    depressed, got hooked on sleeping pills, and Wesley realized that she might
    go for it one of these days. So he thought about how it was his fault that
    she was going through this, and he slept on the ground by her bed every
    night until she got better. He had tears in his eyes when he told me about
    how sorry he was to her. She’s good now, he said, new boyfriend and
    everything.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Anyway, raise your kid to be a giver, not a taker. City’s a dangerous place
    to be because everyone’s got the same wrong definitions—you can just tell
    by the way they look you up and down, thinking about if you’re better or
    they are. That’s the pastime of city people, checking you out, feeling smug
    if they’re above you and anxious if they’re below, you know, getting all
    bug-eyed thinking: <em>Is this guy better-looking than me?</em> Lot of fear. No
    one’s got the right eyes in the city—you know those glittery eyes you see
    in children and dogs? Those shiny smiling eyes, man, that trio of white
    orbs that appear over the pupil like when someone’s telling a funny story
    about someone they loved who’s dead now. The eyes that mean you’re full of
    love. In the city people make their eyes cold, but I get it, because I do
    the same shit—you have to protect yourself from looking like a fool. Don’t
    send your kid to a goddamn school either—you’d trust some stranger to have
    better definitions than you? Man, school’s where a kid goes to die. I bet
    most of the teachers you had were people who were doing the minimum of what
    they could do without getting fired. I had this one teacher named Mr.
    F------. Had him for 10th grade English. We didn’t learn a goddamn thing
    that whole year. We just dicked around. This one time my friend Michael was
    sitting in the front row with his Gameboy playing Pokemon with the sound
    on. F------’s talking, and Michael’s going click, click, click while this
    intense 8-bit battle music's going on. Finally he goes, Michael, please.
    Michael says, I have to beat this boss, Mr. F------, it’s really important.
    F------ sighs and says, Okay, just turn off the volume. Another time we
    tried to order a pizza to our classroom, like my friend Nate was calling
    the pizza guy on his phone, saying, you know, four pepperoni, four
    meatlovers, two dozen wings. In the end, F------ vetoed the whole thing,
    and we grumbled the whole week. Man, at the time I thought I’d lucked out
    getting him because I didn’t have to do shit to get an A in his class. But
    looking back, man, that guy was committing a real crime. You got a whole
    year to show kids why you think reading books is important, and you don’t.
    Four English teachers in four years, and only one of them gave half a shit.
    The rest dicked us around.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I want to tell you about Aashik’s grandpa who died pretty recently. Aashik
    and his family went to the funeral. I think it was in South India,
    Bangalore, where he was from. He says he was really shocked by how many
    people came to pay their respects. Thousands of people, from all over. Even
    an MP came in his helicopter with a bunch of bodyguards. I asked him what
    the hell his grandpa did. I was thinking he was a big shot businessman or
    something. Aashik said he was just the guy in his village that everyone
    would go to talk to when they needed advice. He was from a low caste, too.
    But he helped a lot of people out, including that MP before he become one.
    The way Aashik was talking about all the people there he had this really
    faraway look in his eyes. You could tell he was really proud of his
    grandpa, and I bet he was thinking about how he wanted to be like him too
    someday. Man, someone like him that you could just go and talk to? Wise man
    of the village? A shepard, man, a catcher.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Another thing I want to tell you about Aashik. Sometimes at night I’d see
    him kneeling on his bed. His eyes would be closed and his hands would be
    clasped in his lap, praying. I asked him once what he prayed about. He said
    he prayed for the people in his life and for me, too, that I’d find my way
    soon. I told myself I’d do whatever I could to keep the guy as my friend.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    9.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “YOU CAN’T BE HERE,” says a guy with a flashlight. He’s wearing one of
    those campus security uniforms. We were by the grand entrance of Haas now.
    When I was in high school my brother gave me a little tour of the school
    after I got in. We'd stood in front of that entrance. This was before the
    remodel, and I don’t remember much about what it looked like except that I
    think it was more rustic, a little shabby. It was night then, and there’d
    been fog around the lights of the lamposts. There’d been something really
    impressive about the business school, like really important stuff went on
    in there. Looking up at it and being a kid, I thought: “Man, what the hell
    do you learn about in there?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    "Can you see yourself going here?" He asked me.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    "Yeah, maybe."
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Then sometime when we were in school Haas got remodeled to look like a ski
    resort. I don’t know if it was Aashik or my brother who told me this, but
    all the Haas buildings get re-painted every year. It sure looks that way to
    me. Some of the buildings’ exteriors are lined horizontally from top to
    bottom with wood, you know, to give it some texture, but they’ve been
    re-painted it the same beige-taupe so many times that the paint’s caked
    over those lines. It reminds you of a woman who’s put a ton of foundation
    over her wrinkles. You know those artists’ renderings they do whenever a
    new building’s being designed, like a library or a museum? Those really
    Utopian images where it’s really sunny, the trees are watercolor, greener
    and more ethereal than they should be, and all the people look like they
    have somewhere to be. You look at it and think, “Wow, this museum’s gonna
    give us a brighter future.” Well, I realized something walking by Haas and
    the new art museum on Oxford that looks like an aluminum spaceship, that
    the techno-utopia visions of Cal are the same ones we saw in Ho Chi Minh,
    all those red banners with farmers in their paddies wiping the sweat off
    their brow but smiling really big at the hammer and sickle. You look at all
    the light coming into the windows of a modernist building in those
    renderings, all the people walking around tall and slender with a coffee in
    one hand and the leash of a husky in the other, and you realize that all
    these visions are saying the same thing: in the future, we’ll all have a
    real purpose. In the future, there’ll be no secrets.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I nodded at the security guard and pointed up toward Gayley, toward the
    stadium. I continued that way till I was walking past Unit 2 when I thought
    about going into the courtyard. I don’t know how well you remember it, but
    we were in Davidson, floor six. If you’re coming out of Davidson, on your
    right you’ll see a building called Towle, and that’s for kids who
    transferred from a junior college. I went to the glass door that leads to
    the mailroom and stood there, between two trees in concrete flowerbeds,
    right on the intersection of these four concrete squares. Then I looked up.
    Reason was, freshman year a kid named Henry Treadway unscrewed the window
    of his dorm room so that it could open all the way. Then he jumped out and
    landed right where I was standing.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I know that’s the spot because the next morning all the yellow tape was
    gone, and there was a Hispanic lady mopping up right there. She had her
    back to me, and I was trying to get a look at the spot to see if there was
    any blood there. But she was pretty much finished. She saw me in the glass
    door. Her eyes got big and she turned around.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Your friend?” She whispered.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I shook my head.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    She nodded and stood there for a couple seconds. Then she got back to
    mopping.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I was thinking it would have been nice of her to leave some blood on the
    concrete.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Couple weeks ago when I visited San Fran I asked my friend who makes a
    killing working in tech if she remembered the kid who killed himself our
    freshman year. She’d lived in Ehrman which is across from Davidson.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Yeah, didn’t he do it because he didn’t get into Haas?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Man, it’s like my brother who told me in this conspiratorial whisper that
    Anthony Bourdain killed himself because working in restaurants was too
    stressful. Man, how can people who are so smart know so little? They don’t
    get it. They don’t get that it isn’t one thing, it’s everything.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I remember seeing Henry almost every night before he killed himself. He was
    always smoking in the courtyard on one of those benches by the bike cage. I
    was seeing a girl named Kari at the time who lived in Ehrman, so we were
    always walking back and forth across the courtyard. When I think about
    Henry the image that comes is the flame of his lighter making his face glow
    red. He always gave me these eyes. Not nice eyes, something bad in them.
    Like he knew something about me that Kari didn’t. That’s why I didn’t like
    being cute with Kari around him because he’d always give me those eyes with
    a half-smile.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “It's our friend, Camus,” I always said to her when we saw him. I remember
    making jokes to her that he was going to buy a gun and go berserk one day.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    The night he jumped, Alan, Emmylou, and I went for a walk to smoke a joint.
    When we got back there was an ambulance and yellow tape all over the
    entrance to Towle.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Man, maybe he wasn’t so different from you or me. He probably messed around
    in high school like you and had to go to community college. Then he got
    into Cal, and his mom was saying that they always knew he was the brainiac
    in the family, and in their heads the rest of his life just unrolled before
    him—major in philosophy, get into law school, etc. But it’s not that
    simple. I think about you telling me how you were the valedictorian of your
    class at community college, and how you gave the speech at graduation. And
    then how a semester in—floor six, Davidson—you were peeing into bottles
    because you couldn’t leave your triple room, and you had to withdraw for
    awhile. Not that simple. There’s the fact that you have to live through
    every minute of every day with the disease of the knowledge inside you. If
    you were me, you liked to plan and make lists—the dozen journals you’ve
    kept since you were sixteen because you decided you were going to become <em>a
    writer</em> are filled mostly with the prestige you hoped to have in ten years.
    You want to burn, quietly, lastingly, like you were walking a long journey
    to deliver lost children to their parents. But every minute of every day
    passes you by like you're running away from someone in a dream. You can't
    grip the ground, you seem to bounce. Your punches seem to take place
    underwater. One day you find the solution— it’s your own little pet you
    keep in your coat pocket. You feed it and pet it and watch it grow. One
    evening, sunset, you go to the benches by the bike cage for a smoke like
    you do every night. See that one dumb Asian guy dicking around with his
    friends, only this time you don’t wish upon him the things inside you. Then
    you go back to the room that you have to share with kids who don't get it,
    a room that you’ve taken out a big loan to pay for because it costs you two
    grand a month to share it with another grown man who talks to his
    long-distance girlfriend every night under his sheets. You wonder if that
    debt is real or if it’s more like a cancer that’ll form within you in your
    fifties. You remember how you used to sit by the creek with the red-orange
    crawfish and the gangly tadpoles, and how you’d stroke the moss by you,
    lost in the thought that it might be the canopy of a miniature forest,
    under which were miniature jaguars and poison dart frogs and pyramids made
    of gold. When you were little, you you always thought there was more to
    something than there really was. You believed in the whole universe that
    movies and books create. But when got older you saw that only slices of it
    had been created. You believed for example that you could nestle in the
    beauty of a girl forever, but now you wonder if it’s only a matter of time before you’re cellmates with her. Man, you’d give
    anything to go live in that dream—waking up cold at night next to her and
    the no-better rightness of the sleepy ache as you fit your limbs into hers,
    then the fat fold between the wrists and fists of your children, then the
    cabin and the stove and the snow that makes your face sting and your
    thoughts clean, then the rock of being a father—
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Sit there for a while.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
   <em>“Plunge recklessly toward an irrational death, and you will awaken from
    your dreams.”</em>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    So you jump, man, right from the sixth floor. You see the ground come at
    you way too quickly, a bark escapes your throat, you land on your neck and
    lie there broken, all your joints pointing the wrong way like a goddamn
    Picasso. What are you thinking about? Hold on, you think, hold on, I'm
    having some new thoughts, and I need more time ...
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    You know it only takes you four seconds to fall from the Golden Gate? 245
    feet, 75 miles per hour. Four-story buildings are only, what, forty feet? I
    don't know the math, but I don't think that's a lot of time to think or a
    lot of height to reach a fast speed. Some people don't die instantly when
    they hit the water. They drown or die of hypothermia. Man. I’m guessing
    they’re feeling strong when they’re flying at the water, going faster than
    a car on the freeway. They’re probably willing themselves to go faster,
    faster. Probably can’t hear a thing. Finally it’ll all be over, they’re
    thinking. The black water’s getting closer and closer—1, 2, 3, 4—Blam. But
    it’s not over. They’re in the water now—bones shattered and skin
    shredded—in the coldest water they’ve ever been in. They probably plummet
    deep, deep into the ocean, and they can't paddle up to the surface because
    they’re broken, so they’re just floating. I'm guessing they got a minute.
    Man, that’s a dark minute. I heard that a lot of people change their minds
    when they're dying from suicide, like from pills. I figure it’s because
    they’ve never been in that kind of situation before and it gives them new
    eyes. Emmylou told me that she heard Henry didn't die right away, that he
    was lying there gurgling and wheezing like he got the wind knocked out of
    him, which I guess he probably did. Oh man, I hope Henry didn't change his
    mind about wanting to die as he lay there all mangled on the cement. I hope
    he wanted it, right till the end.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I have a friend named Ben Moon. Second of four brothers, all of whom won
    the IQ jackpot and went to Ivy League schools. Youngest brother’s in high
    school now, but he's probably going that way, too. Anyway, the third son,
    Bernard, he was a senior in high school when he died. You could tell by his
    friends at his memorial that he was cool. Good-looking friends who squared
    themselves up to the world. I remember his dad saying he had narrowed down
    his choices to Cal and Brown but was leaning toward Brown. His dad had this
    one story of how Bernard had come back from his interview with Brown
    telling him don’t worry, he’d got it, no problem.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    How do you know? His dad asked him as they drove back home.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I got it, he said. 100%.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Ben played a song Bernard had made. It was a hokey song, with synth
    violins. Knowing Ben, who showed me all this good music, he knew it was
    hokey, but he still played it. And it was moving now, because the kid was
    dead.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Ben Moon’s the kind of guy you’re almost afraid of because of how smart he
    is. It’s humbling to talk to him about something because you know he
    probably knows more about the thing than you do. I don’t how many times
    I’ve been burned trying to sound smart about something and finding out that
    he’s gone a lot further in that thing than I have. In high school once I
    was showing him my music collection and showing him that I only downloaded
    in the highest quality. He smiles a little and asks me if I’ve ever heard
    of FLAC or WAV, and then he showed me this one website where you could
    download albums in those formats. The website was really exclusive—a member
    had to invite you or you had to pass an interview with one of the
    moderators. In the interview you got asked a bunch of questions about
    things like bitrate and ripping and a lot of other stuff I still don’t know
    about. I asked him how he got in and he said passed the interview. Then he
    sent me an invite, even thought it was wasted on me.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Another time I was over at Ben’s house and everyone was playing video games
    in this game room where they had a couch and a bunch of superfast
    computers. His folks had a really nice big house in one of those gated
    communities where every house looks the same, just turned 90 degrees. They
    had a pool, too, and I was thinking he’d had a good childhood. Man, his
    engineer dad even taught him calculus when he was about 13.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Anyway, I was never good at video games so I was just listening to some
    music with this really nice pair of headphones he had. They were huge and
    comfy, and one of the guys asked me if I’d found any intelligent life yet.
    Haha. I was listening to all my favorite songs again because I was hearing
    things in them I’d never heard before, and it was making me happy. I must
    have fallen asleep at some point, but I remember Ben putting a blanket over
    me. What I want to say is that he's stupid smart, but he’s a real guy, too.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    At his brother’s memorial the oldest brother whose name is Brian got up and
    told a story about how this one time Bernard was on the phone with his
    girlfriend in his room. Brian and Ben were back from college so the whole
    family was there. Brian had this idea of the three brothers sneaking up on
    Bernard and scaring the shit out of him. They crawled along his carpet to
    his bed and they had this signal where they all jumped on him at the same
    time.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I didn’t know he was capable of screaming like that,” Brian said, and
    everyone laughed. I looked over at his girlfriend. She was biting her lip
    and looking down. I was thinking about all the brothers messing around like
    that and now one of them dead, and I damn near cried in my seat, too.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    How Bernard died from what I heard was that he was with his friends at an
    elementary school. They were doing something for the science fair, and they
    had, I think, propane gas canisters like the ones you use for camping, and
    also a skateboard. They were trying to propel the skateboards with them or
    something. I don't know exactly. It was probably a lot smarter than it
    sounds, you know, like they probably weren't stabbing the canisters with a
    screwdriver and flicking a lighter at the leak. Anyway, one of them
    exploded in his face and he bled to death. Man, one minute you're joking
    around with your friends—it's the end of senior year, you got a cute smart
    girlfriend, you got a car, and in a couple months you're going to beautiful
    Brown where Ben went—then suddenly there’s a bang and a flash and your
    vision's getting dimmer, there's this warm soup all over your neck, and
    you’re wondering why your friends are looking at you in a way they never
    have and why you suddenly feel real cold and sleepy, and you think it might
    be good to close your eyes for a minute.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I was thinking about how his mom was probably at home when she got the
    call. Maybe she was getting ready for bed, and she'd told Bernard to come
    home before midnight. She and her husband were glad he'd come out like his
    older brothers, no smoking, no drinking. Just science fair stuff. Then she
    gets a call from the hospital. Been an accident, come as soon as possible.
    Man, she knows. Because they’d tell her if he was going to be alright.
    She's in a dream when they take her downstairs. She knows they only take
    corpses downstairs. Then there's a gurney with a white sheet over it—peaked
    at the nose, the lips, and the big toes—and she pulls it back.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    That elementary school was closed the next day.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “That spot,” the kids would have said when they got back to school, “a kid
    died there. Right there.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “A gas tank exploded in his face. Like a grenade. The shrapnel cut his
    jugular.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “My brother said that if you cut your jugular you automatically bleed to
    death. Even a paper cut, you'll bleed to death.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Look how the concrete's darker. That's blood, that's his blood.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “You can't wash blood out, my brother said it's only thing you can't wash
    out.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I heard there wasn't any blood in his body by the time they got him into
    the ambulance. He was flat, like he got run over or something.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “You know he went here, a long time ago? Ms. Corlew remembers him. She said
    he was really smart, a real genius. All the brothers were.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Bernard died right there, like the intersection of the concrete squares
    where Henry landed. I think it would be good to put an engraving on the
    spots where people have died, just a little symbol or an initial and a
    1993-2015 or something. Then when you're walking around all caught up in
    your thoughts, you might see one and it'd make you think for a bit. They do
    that when someone dies in a car or bike accident. They'll paint a bike
    white and chain it to a pole near where the person got hit or they'll make
    a mini Catholic shrine. You see them a lot when you're driving bendy
    mountain roads. There'll be flowers and little trinkets with a photo of the
    dead person. Usually, it's a Hispanic person, and usually they're young.
    Young kid like Bernard, why take him? What were all his brains for, all the
    tennis lessons and the college applications and his great confidence if he
    was just going to be taken away like that?
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    My mom told me that when she was little her older sister died in her sleep
    of carbon monoxide poisoning. A few days earlier my mom had slept over at
    her sister’s house, who was married. She told her sister she should get her
    pipes looked at because a couple times in the middle of the night she had
    woken up gasping. Couple days later her sister died in her sleep. I
    remember my mom told me this while I was walking past her in the living
    room. I stopped to listen to her and she began to cry. She said it could
    have been her who died. She asked me if I thought God would have sent her
    to hell. She said she didn’t think so, that it didn’t matter who she was or
    what she had or hadn’t done because she was so young. I thought of my mom
    as a child, youngest of seven, wide-eyed in mortal fear as she stood at the
    doorway to the bedroom where her sister lay. The whole family huddled in
    there quiet and crying. I thought of her sister who was eternally young in
    my mind and who must have looked like my mother when she was young.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    My mother’s parents owned an undergarments shop and put their kids to work.
    Someone they knew told her parents that her older brother had a brain and
    should go to school. He had wanted to go, too. “When can I go to school?”
    My mom remembers him asking his dad. But he didn’t let him. Instead he had
    him deliver undergarments by bicycle every morning. One winter he got a bad
    cough and died.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I walked back home from Unit 2 along Dwight and past People’s Park. It’s
    grim walking by that park at night. You think about the myths they gave us
    about how in the 60s this park was full of all these fresh kids with big
    glasses and high-waisted pants protesting for free speech or civil rights.
    Now you’ll hardly see a student there, just homeless people with their
    shopping carts and blue tarps setting up camp for the night. Black garbage
    bags split open and ragged clothes all over the sidewalk, those cardboard
    takeout boxes with rotting food all mashed and thrown around. Sometimes
    needles. People howling, people laughing and talking to themselves. You’ll
    hardly see a girl walking by that park at night, and if you do she’ll
    practically run by it.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Nowadays there aren’t too many tress in that park, just stumps. I was
    guessing they’d been cut down pretty recently because there were a lot of
    cockroaches sniffing and feeling around. That’s what happens when you chop
    down a lot of trees. All the roaches that lived in them were roaming around
    now. There was one right by my foot. I bent down to get a good look at the
    guy. Shiny, gummy, amber-brown thing with thorny legs and grooves on its
    back like a fingerprint. Missing the last half of one of his legs, thing
    was just hanging off the ground. He was waving his feelers curiously at my
    foot. Some people really hate the critters, but they don’t give me the same
    reaction that those big jungle centipedes and the potato bugs with their
    fat juicy yellow legs do. Cockroaches though, they’re like scarab beetles.
    They look like very fine machines to me. There’s something analytical,
    thoughtful even, about the way they move their feelers, and the way they’ll
    respond to your vibrations. Even their heads look like they’ve been clicked
    into place, and that they’d spark and be a mess of chips and wires if you
    stepped on one of them. I did my best to avoid that, though, all the way
    down Dwight till I got back onto Telegraph. Aashik and Axel’s apartment was
    right where Berkeley turns into Oakland, where Telegraph starts to die.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    All the way back I was imagining my mom’s dead brother going to school for
    the first time. I bet he’d have a couple new pencils and some new clothes,
    or maybe just some hand-me-downs that his mom washed and ironed for him the
    night before. Thought about his eight brothers and sisters buzzing around
    him as he eats a sturdy breakfast that morning, teasing him. But
    inside, they’re proud. Thought about him sitting up straight at his desk
    before school starts while all the other kids are running around. There’s a
    freshly sharpened pencil lined up on it, and he loves that thing—how sharp
    the tip is, how pristine the pink eraser—and he promises himself he’s going
    to work as hard as he can because it sure beats riding his bike every
    morning. And me, man, throwing it all away without telling my parents to
    try to prove something that didn’t even matter.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    10.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    WE WENT OUT to San Francisco that night with Aashik’s friends, Polk Street.
    I always have these expectations for bars, and then you go to them and no
    one even talks to anyone outside their group, at least in the cities. Then
    even within your group all people want to talk about is some meal they had,
    like they’ve just had a religious experience with the damn Pieta. That's
    all they got is food. Like one of Aashik’s friends was telling me that he
    was tired of giving his soul to this company that was about to roll out
    self-driving cars. He was a sincere guy, small and skinny with a nice smile
    and brown, curly hair. Anyway, he tells me he wants out. That got me
    excited, you know, I was going, Yes man, get the hell outta here.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “What are you going to do?” I asked him. “You probably got enough savings
    to do whatever the hell you want. You gonna have a great adventure?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I want to eat good food man,” he said. “I want to travel the world and eat
    good food.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “That’s it?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Yeah. Have you ever been to Singapore?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “No.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “You have to go to Singapore and try the satay there. Literally heaven in
    my mouth.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Man, you’d think that food was the greatest good we ever got. You think a
    Michelin-Star satay would have stopped Henry from jumping? Dangle that shit
    out the window and tell him to come off the ledge?
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    There was a girl with us who was one of Aashik’s friends from one of his
    business classes. She was interested in me from the beginning of the night,
    and I figured I could use it. We went from bar to bar, and when I went
    outside for some air she followed me out and was familiar with me like we’d
    been going out for a while. She had a big chest and she kept brushing up
    against me. She was like a little girl with her high voice. She’d just
    finished an internship at Nielsen, where they do all the TV ratings, and
    she’d just gotten something full time at Unilever, that company whose fuzzy
    “U” you see on everything, from shampoo bottles to peanut butter jars. Data
    analysis, she said. Wow, I said. She told me all of this in that very rich
    voice that successful people have when they’re talking about their careers.
    She asked me what I was up to. Not much, I said. But then I told her a
    little about my travels and the scars on my thighs, and there was a lurch.
    I want to see them, she said, and brought her chest against me again.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Then after some drinks we went over the bridge back to her apartment. Our
    driver was an older guy who drove sometimes on the weekends for some extra
    money. He had a little trouble with how to get onto the Bay Bridge and how
    to get off, and the girl was very sure with the directions. You’re a
    superstar, he told her. He knew what was going on and kept hinting that he
    was really happy for me, and I tried to buy into it too but the night was
    bruised with the feeling that we were going to use each other. After some
    wine in foam cups we went to her bed and when I finished the air was
    metallic and after I washed I left her apartment and walked out down a hill
    back home. Felt like I needed to have a real human moment so I hit up a
    girl named Natalie who I knew was having a birthday party at her pre-med
    frat. I went over and headed right for the liquor. I was already messed up
    but you can always use some more when you’re at a new place. There were
    still a lot of people at the party, but it was that part of the night where
    drinking more just makes you dead in the eyes. I go sit across from these
    two girls on a couch. We were talking a little. The older one was an
    alumna, she was at real med school now, Harvard. Damn, <em>Har</em>vard, I kept
    saying, and they laughed at that. The younger one was a freshman, cute
    delicate girl. She wasn’t drinking, and she was being shy. I poured shots
    and pushed them toward them.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Then this guy comes up to me, and goes: They’ve had enough. The guy is
    pissed. I tell him to sit down and have a drink with us. What’s your name,
    man? Elliott. The guy won’t move. His fists are clenched, his breathing’s
    heavy, looks like he wants to murder me. He’s having a real moment, like
    all his life he’s wanted to have one brave moment, and he sees me and goes
    for it.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Calm down,” I tell him. “Have a drink.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “No,” he says. “She’s had enough.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I’m guessing he’s talking about the freshman, because the older girl just
    looks amused. The freshman girl whose name is Sara looks like she wants to
    disappear.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Look man,” I say. “Why don’t you let your friend decide for herself?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    The guy doesn’t say anything, just stands right in front of me.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I’m just trying to have a drink with your friends, man. I’m not trying to
    rape them.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    By now, there are a couple of his friends leering over at us. Man, when I
    said that, I might as well have said that I was trying to rape them. They
    got all excited, all primal, like I was the goddamn devil, man, and I was
	wondering if they could <em>smell</em> it on me. Then one of them, big gym guy, came
    up to me and asked me who I knew here.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I just wanted to show them I wasn’t a bad guy so I turned to Elliott and
    asked him if he wanted to go outside to talk it out. I just wanted to make
    a real goddamn connection, man, just have a real goddamn human moment. But
    everyone there thought I was saying that I wanted to fight the guy, and
    finally Natalie told me it’d be best if I left. She talked to me outside
    for a minute, telling me that Elliott and Sara went way back to when they
    were kids, had grown up together and all that. Well, how the hell was I
    supposed to know that I was playing an extra in their goddamn Korean drama?
    But I was so messed up that I just told her <em>okay, okay I get it</em>. I decided
    to run back home, as fast as I could, and fell over a couple times. Couple
    miles later I entered the apartment. I couldn’t breathe, felt like someone
    was squeezing my brain. My heart was going real fast, man, thought I was
    having a heart attack, and I was spiralling real bad, trying to bottom out
    by telling myself things that I was sure about, trying to find some
    footing. I was a freak, man, I knew it, and so did everyone else.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Oh man,” I whispered as I walked around the apartment. “Oh man, oh man, oh
    man.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I’ll take a bath, I thought. A hot bath will help me.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Took off my clothes and ran the hot water. Put my mouth underwater and
    screamed. I was panicking real bad, man. Everything was coming up now. Man,
    I wanted to kill my dad for doing what he did to me. Man, I wanted to kill
    him, and I wanted to kill my brother, too. I put my mouth to the faucet and
    coughed as it came into my lungs. I thrust my head underwater. My forehead
    struck the tub floor. The water fell over my head and rumbled around me. I
    put my hands over my ears and started pulling at my hair. Man, nothing was
    ever going to change for me. Again and again, I thought. Day after day,
    night after night, year after year. Back on that island one day we tried to
    take the skiff to mainland. It was raining, and then it became a storm. We
    were all turned around, and we were running out of gas. Richard was going,
    “Damn, had to be the ocean, huh?” But I figured it wasn’t a bad way to go
    and thought there was a real beauty to the lightning drawing itself down
    onto the horizon like fine white roots and the waves dimpled by the rain
    and our smallness in the ocean. Then everyone laughed and clapped me on the
    back. The island had appeared before us as a dark forested mound.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Man, sitting in that tub I was wishing I had died out there.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    The door boomed behind me.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Come in!” I shouted.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    It was Aashik. He said something I couldn’t hear.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Come in!” I shouted again. The door was locked. I reached over and
    unlocked it, slapping it out with a wet hand.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “What are you doing?” He asked me.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I slapped the water. “Taking a bath.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Why?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I don't know.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “How you feeling? You ran home?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Yeah. I fell, too. Fucked my knee.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “How you feeling?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Not too good. I'm going to throw up.” I crawled to the toilet and began
    retching. Then I started to cry like I’d never cried before.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I'm sorry,” I said. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry, man.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “What happened?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Aashik, I’m a piece of shit. I’m a piece of shit, man. I’m sorry. I’m
    sorry.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “What happened?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Everything, man, everything. I’m a piece of shit. I don't have fucking
    anything. I have nothing, man, nothing.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I kept saying that over and over again and crying with my head against his
    leg. He put a towel over my back and his hand on my head and I heard him
    cry quietly, too.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    11.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    JUST LAST MONTH I was at my brother’s wedding. It was a very fine wedding.
    My brother rented out an entire restaurant at Bryant Park. We took our
    photos in front of the steps of the New York Public Library, at dinner
    there was steak, the waitstaff was offering plates of hors d'oeuvres, and
    my wine glass was fat the whole night. It was a rare experience for someone
    like me who doesn’t make much money and lives with his parents.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I was one of the groomsmen and the ring-bearer. It had been humid the day
    before, but today it was cool, and the evening was coming. There were about
    a hundred guests seated on the terrace overlooking a large lawn of grass on
    which hundreds of New Yorkers were picnicking. Scattered throughout the
    park was a bronze bust of Goethe, and Gertrude Stein looking homely and
    motherly. Before them lay a stage over which a banner read: OTHELLO 7 PM. I
    was wearing a tuxedo that my brother had had sent to me a week prior to
    secure its fit. My brother and his bride read their vows, something about
    loading the dishwasher and closing the kitchen cabinets, and while the
    other groomsmen beamed and chuckled towards them, I looked away.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I figure my brother and I have spoken about five hours in the past decade.
    The last meaningful encounter I had with him before the wedding happened
    about a year ago when he came home for a week. After you and I parted ways
    in Nashville, I spent a long month hitchhiking back to California through
    middle America. Spent two hard weeks hiking the Colorado Trail and came
    down the Grand Canyon on a full moon. The moonlight on the walls of that
    canyon made it look like a gothic cathedral. From Salt Lake I train hopped
    back to San Francisco and got on a bus back home to LA.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    My brother came into my room one day just before I was going out for a run
    and asked me where his hiking pack was. I told him that I had sold it to my
    friend. That was you. He hadn’t used it in years, and I thought he wouldn’t
    notice it was gone or that he wouldn’t care because he made a lot of money.
    He was angry with me. I asked him how much it cost. He told me I owed him
    $150, so I gave it to him right there in cash. He kept telling me not to
    touch his stuff. I told him that since I had just paid him, that was the
    end. He wouldn’t stop, though, said he was only angry because I had sold
    it. It’s the principle, he said. Man, I was thinking about how I was
    working from sunup to midnight now putting up Christmas lights for fifteen
    bucks an hour, and I didn’t want to hear him talk about principle. My mom
    came between us now. I put my finger on him and cursed him with a severity
    that frightened all of us. Then I left. I started running up near these
    hills, thinking about how my parents had to choose, him or me, because I
    didn’t want anything to do with him anymore. When I got to the top and the
    whole city was in view I got to my knees and started to cry.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Couple weeks ago you told me that when you saw your mother for the first
    time in two years, she cried. I bet you saw her in a different way. Man,
    it’s a shame that for all we think we’ve learned, we still don’t know how
    to be brothers and sons.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    My brother and mother had their dance before the wedding dinner. They
    danced to the song “Moon River” by Audrey Hepburn. My mother approached my
    brother with the hurt eyes of someone who’s trying hard not to cry, and my
    brother’s were big with the fear that she might fall apart in his arms. It
    was when I saw the light on her cheekbone that an image from a dream I had
    appeared in my mind: it’s my mother on a bed. Her eyes are sunken in, her
    hair is white and floats in the morning light, and her bones poke from her
    skin and gown. She’s halfway into another world now, more spirit than body.
    Looking at her now, dancing with my brother, I saw her as the little girl
    standing at her doorway as her sister lay dead, and I saw her crying about
    it too in our living room fifty years later. I saw her as the kid whose
    father told her to bring her back a pack of cigarettes. She went to the
    store but along the way she met her friend, and they jumped rope until the
    sun went down. She came back home empty-handed, and her dad spanked her.
    When she told me that story, she laughed. I thought about her driving to
    the mall parking lot to cry because she didn’t have any friends in America
    and because she wasn’t sure who she’d married. She and my dad ran a
    cleaner’s when they came to America, and they worked day and night. One day
    she skipped work without telling my dad and took my brother to the park to
    ride his new bike. Later, he hit her. Man, I thought about the shame of my
    mother walking around with a black eye, my brother knowing and not knowing.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    After dinner I met eyes with someone I had spotted earlier, a man my
    brother has known since high school. He was there with his girlfriend. His
    name was Jason.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I remember you,” I told him. “I remember thinking when I saw you: that’s a
    good-looking man.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    He laughed, and we talked for a few minutes. Then he looked me right in the
    eye and said: “Do you know what your brother said about you a few days
    ago?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “What’s that?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “He said that he was really hard on you when you were little. But he said
    that you were the smartest person he knew, and the best soccer player. ”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Shortly after this, I was standing at the bar when another man approached
    me. He was my brother’s friend from college. They had been in the same
    fraternity.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “James’ brother,” he said to me. We shook hands. He asked me what I was
    drinking. I told him I was going for a whiskey.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Let’s do a tequila shot,” he said.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    So we did, with the lime and the salt.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “What was going on with you up there?” He asked me.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I asked him what he meant. He said that I looked like I really didn’t want
    to be there. “Who is that guy?” He had asked his friend during the
    ceremony. That, his friend told him, is his brother.

    If only you knew, I wanted to tell the guy, but inside I was really ashamed
    for what I’d done. I’d promised myself that I wouldn’t say a word out of
    line for the few days that I was in New York. It’s my brother’s wedding, I
    reasoned, and he’s chosen me as one of his groomsmen and the ring-bearer.
    So I was thinking I’d be gracious. But something had come over me as I
    stood at the altar: I saw inside me that I still hated him. I told the man
    that I was ashamed of myself. He told me that I should go talk to my
    brother.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    The night continued from the bar to a club across the street, and I found
    myself sitting beside another one of the groomsmen who was heaving into a
    silver dish that was shaped like a dog’s bowl. My sister had been coaxed
    into having too many drinks by the other groomsmen, and her boyfriend was
    trying to keep her upright on the dance floor. My brother came over to me,
    and I rose to greet him. He told me that he was sorry for how he had
    treated me in the past. He said that it hurt him when I didn’t ask him to
    bail me out in Nicaragua, and he embraced me. Tears came freely down my
    face, and I put my arms around him. I saw him then as my strong brother,
    who was a husband now and a father soon, and I wished we could be real
    brothers.

    TWO DAYS after that night with Aashik, I was on the John Muir Trail. I
    figured it was time to head back to LA to my parents, and I thought I’d do
    a long hike to get there. I took a train to Merced and hopped on a bus to
    get to Yosemite Valley.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I had a lot of extra stuff with me because I was moving, like my laptop and
    clothes and books, so I was packing close to 50 lbs. Man, I really
    overestimated my strength there. First day was a half day, so it was
    alright. It was the beginning of a long climb, something like a mile-gain
    over 15 miles. There were a lot of day hikers on the trail, too. Up, up,
    up. Second day was where it hurt. I’d banged my knee pretty good when I
    fell running back to the apartment, so I made a wooden staff and used it
    like a crutch whenever I went downhill. Man, crawling up, up, up while
    you’re surrounded by trees. Not so many people around to talk to, either. I
    thought I was hearing voices in the scratch of squirrel claws gripping tree
    bark or the gurgling streams, whispers in the brush. Thought I was seeing
    tents where there were boulders and hikers where there were saplings. Eyes
    in the dark knots of aspens. I had to stop every ten minutes to rest, too.
    I didn’t know how to properly adjust my pack so it was hanging off me and
    killing my shoulders. It was so heavy for me that I had to prop it up and
    sit down to get the straps on. My head was becoming a bad place. I got to a
    point where I was so tired that I got my sleeping bag out and went inside
    it for a few minutes just a couple feet off the trail. But I was thinking
    I’d be embarrassed if someone saw me like that, so I took a couple bites
    from a bar and kept going. Five minutes later, Tuolumne Meadows opened up
    to me like a goddamn postcard. I never saw beauty like that before.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Between the grandfatherly granite domes on either side, brown brooks cut
    through a plain of tall lush grass carrying water so clear that you only
    knew it was there because the sun glittered on it, and so appetizing that
    when you leaned over to cup it to your lips, you felt stronger. There was a
    great feeling of vitality in the meadow, as if the sun shone more brightly
    upon it, as if the rich black-brown soil was denser with nutrients, the
    water with more minerals. It was in the sweet cold air, the kind that you
    breathe in after a snowfall, in the green pines that were strong and
    healthy, in the shiny, athletic deer that grazed and leapt lightly from
    each other, and in all the colors, too: the sky was bluer and deeper, the
    clouds richer, the wildflowers with their plump, velvet petals
    concentrating blues, whites, oranges, and purples in a way that I only
    thought the birds and fishes of the tropics could do. I walked through that
    meadow in a daze that something like this was real, and that I was in it.
    Then I thought about what Aashik had done for me, and I started to cry. I
    got to my knees because I couldn’t see where I was going. Man, to have a
    friend like him who’d see you broken like that and cry with you. I promised
    myself that someday I’d get him back a hundred times over for what he did
    for me. I didn’t deserve that, and I didn’t deserve to walk in a place as
    beautiful as this, or to be with the grasses and the brown brook, the deer,
    and the mountains, all of these things that were beautiful and didn’t even
    know it. But it’s been given to me, I thought, and I got to my feet and
    just kept walking on with tears coming down my face. I didn’t want to live
    the way I’d been living anymore, man. I wanted to be clean.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Two years later that same feeling visited me again.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    After I got back from Bonnaroo, Taqueria opened a second restaurant a
    couple miles from the first. You and I were going to work there. We had a
    soft opening for family and friends, and I had a double that day. JC was
    being neurotic because Tony was there. I worked at my usual pace, but JC
    kept ordering me around. I hadn’t eaten anything that day. The layout of
    the restaurant was different, all the napkins, plates, silverware, and
    towels were in different places, and learning all of this again was
    frustrating. I slowed down toward the end of the night as customers began
    to leave. JC waddled over with his big ass and told me to keep moving. I
    told him to calm down. He told me not to tell him that, and there was a
    glint, gleeful almost, in his eye that made me think this was about race
    now.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Calm down.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    He walked away.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Tony came over later and apologized to me. He told me I had to think about
    his “main motive,” that he wanted a happy restaurant, a happy family here.
    I told him that wasn’t his main motive.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Well then, what’s my main motive?”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Your main motive is to make money.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    When my shift ended I rode my bike back to work. Cars rushed by in both
    directions. I went out on the middle of the road. A car stopped for me. I
    pedaled quickly past it. Then I got hit by a car, and I was thrown
    backwards. I saw the night sky swivel before me, and I had one very quiet
    thought, that that was that.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I hit the ground on my hip and my elbow and wrist, and as soon as I
    realized that I wasn’t going to die—man, everything came up inside me,
    right from my chest, and I wanted to scream. I never been so strong in my
    life. When I told you this story you said it was adrenaline, but I’ve felt
    adrenaline plenty of times, and it wasn’t that. There’s an animalism within
    adrenaline, the potential of violence to achieve some end. You think about
    the eyes of an animal when it’s trapped. This was different. It was the
    most powerful thing I’ve ever felt—there was no shame, no doubt, no fear—it
    was only one thing, a single force in my whole body that was telling me
    what I had to do. I had to make things right with everyone in my life. My
    parents, my brother, my sister, and you, and of course I was willing to
    look like a fool to see it through. I got a second chance, man.
</p>

    A few weeks earlier I had gone off you. We were at a bar with Julio. Every
    Wednesday they had a buy one, get one special. My drink was five dollars so
    I tipped one. You sniggered, and I got angry. I thought about how you still
    owed me 800 bucks, how I had bought the motorcycle that we now shared, how
    I had cooked for you at Lutsen and done things for you that you never
    noticed, and how many times I wished I was travelling alone. All the way
    back to the car I shouted at you about how you were a shitty friend. You
    kept saying I was right and to stop. You said it was hard being around me,
    too. But I couldn’t stop and I kept shouting at you. Couple days later when
    we were walking back home with a six-pack of good beer you turned to me and
    you said I had been a good friend to you. You said you didn’t think you had
    been a good one. I was very ashamed when you said that. I was thinking
    about when I was at Bonnaroo with Carley. You sent me a text that you were
    going through a couple six-packs every day and that you were in a dark
    place right now. I remember looking at my phone and putting it away. Man,
    I’ll never do that again.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    When we first got into Nashville we were at that hostel on D.B. Todd for a
    few weeks. Couple weeks in I got a message from the hostel owner that we
    had to move out because we were messy. You and I were working at Taqueria
    when I got the message. I showed it to you, right by the double doors to
    the kitchen, and we looked at each other. Then we started laughing. Later
    you apologized to the owner and said that you were going through a hard
    time. You said I should get to stay because you had been the messy one. You
    told me you would find your own housing. But we moved out together anyway
    and found that house with the porch. We’d get some good beer and talk for
    hours about everything on that porch. I never enjoyed a beer more with
    anyone than with you. We would ride on the bike together to go to work or
    to go grocery shopping. You drove because you’re bigger than me. Maybe
    you’re a better driver, too. On a nice stretch of road I would lean back on
    the seat rest and feel the way I used to when I was little and hung out
    with my big brother. I remembered how when this all started it was supposed
    to be you and me, Kerouac and Cassady, running and stumbling through the
    deserts and mountains and plains of America.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I got up from the street. There were headlights hurtling past me. Man, I
    wanted to scream I felt so good. I took my mangled bike to the sidewalk and
    limped over to the woman who had come out of the car that hit me. She was
    crying.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I’m okay,” I said. “I’m okay. It was my fault.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Well, God bless you,” she cried into her hands, and I held out my arms to
    hug her.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    A guy who’d seen the crash asked me if I wanted a ride home.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I thought I saw you die, man,” he said as he drove.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Yeah.”
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I was going to get home and hug you and tell you I loved you. You were on
    that front porch smoking and listening to music. You heard me coming up
    that long gravel driveway, and you were grinning when you asked me how work
    was. But then you saw me limping and you saw the look in my eyes. Yours got
    big and you made me sit down in your chair, and you lit me a cigarette
    because my hands were trembling. So I never got to do that.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Well, now you’re in Bangkok teaching English. Sometimes I can’t believe how
    long you’ve been in that jungle, but it’s coming on two years now. I think
    about you a lot over there in Siam getting in your taxi with your boys,
    going from Khao San, with the African prostitutes and the guttural ladyboys
    and the vice-like euphoria of those balloons and the gooey black scorpions
    on skewers, to Soi Cowboy and that place by your apartment with the pink
    light.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    I’ve been looking at some dirt-cheap land in the Olympic National Forest.
    Cheap because even though it’s on a nice lake, you need a boat to get
    there. It’s surrounded on its other three sides by mountains and
    rainforest, and there are no roads to get there. So I’m thinking of
    spending some time there to get myself right, and if you want you can come
    visit. I think it’ll be good for you and me, to go back to where you got to
    work for everything. We’ll have the whole forest to bang around in, and we
    can be like kids again. We can build shit, hunt deer and elk, fish for
    rainbow trout and sockeye salmon, and follow the Quinault into Enchanted
    Valley. I’ve only seen videos and photos of Olympia and the Hoh Rainforest,
    but it looks wet, lush, and ancient, like Dionysius’ll be there dancing in a
    ring with his all maenads and dryads. Maybe I’ll have a little cabin set up
    before you get there. And maybe there’ll be a little porch for it, too, or
    maybe just a couple stumps in front of a big fire, and we can talk.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Meanwhile I’ll think about poor Henry Treadway. I'll think about poor Bernard
    Moon who’d be starting his senior year at Brown now, my mom’s sister waking
    up dead and her brother wanting to go to school, John, Richard, the little
    girl wondering how you can kill yourself, my mom the same age we are now
    and on her knees asking God to help her with my dad, and my dad as a kid
    tugging on strangers to ask them if they had seen his mother. About
    Alex as a kid punching the wall by her bed and wishing things were
    different and wanting her to know that I’m there for her if she wants. My
    mom crying on my brother’s chest to “Moon River.” Your mom and her mom
    going around to all the bars to find her dad, and how dangerous your eyes
    got when your dad told you over the phone that we couldn’t crash at his
    house in Nashville. I think about you sitting by yourself in Cafe Coco.
    You'd told your mom that it would be better to die than to live with all
    your worries. Then at the table you wept. I think also about when we went
    to the thrift store to find boots for you in Minneapolis. It was the middle
    of winter and we were about to go start work up at Lutsen. There weren’t a
    lot of options because your feet are so damn big, but we looked and looked
    and I found you a pair. You laced them up and said, I’m glad you’re my
    friend, man.
